        "ambiguos question": "Jerry had 7 books and some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?",
        "clear answer": "To determine how many more books than action figures were on Jerry's shelf, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Count of Books and Action Figures:**\n   - Jerry initially had 7 books.\n   - Jerry initially had 3 action figures.\n\n2. **Adding More Action Figures:**\n   - Jerry added 2 more action figures to his shelf.\n   - New count of action figures = Initial count + Added action figures = 3 + 2 = 5 action figures.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Now, we need to calculate how many more books than action figures Jerry has:\n   - Difference = Number of books - Number of action figures = 7 - 5 = 2.\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 2 more books than action figures on his shelf.\n\n### 2",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of books and the number of action figures on Jerry's shelf after he adds 2 more action figures.\n\n1. **Initial Information:**\n   - Number of books: 7\n   - Number of action figures: Let's assume he initially had \\( x \\) action figures.\n\n2. **Action Taken:**\n   - Jerry adds 2 more action figures. This means he now has \\( x + 2 \\) action figures.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n   We want to find how many more books there are than action figures. We calculate this as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Number of books} - \\text{Number of action figures} \n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values we have:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 7 - (x + 2) = 7 - x - 2\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 5 - x\n   \\]\n\nThis tells us that in order to find the numerical value of the difference, we need a specific value for \\( x \\), the original number of action figures.\n\nSince we need a concrete numeric answer, I will assume a random value for \\( x \\). Let's assume Jerry initially had 3 action figures. This means:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial number of action figures} = 3 \n   \\]\n\nAfter adding 2 more action figures, he has:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total action figures} = 3 + 2 = 5\n   \\]\n\nNow we calculate the final difference:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 7 - 5 = 2\n   \\]\n\n### \nTherefore, there are 2 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf given the assumed initial number of action figures.",

        "ambiguos question": "Haley had some trees initially. After a typhoon, 13 trees in her backyard died. How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trees survived the typhoon and then compare this number with the number of trees that died. \n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Condition:** \n   - Haley initially had 3 trees in her backyard.\n \n2. **Determine the Number of Trees that Died:**\n   - According to the problem, 13 trees died during the typhoon. However, since Haley initially had only 3 trees, it seems inconsistent that more trees could die than she originally planted.\n\n3. **Additional Assumption:**\n   - There seems to be a mistake in the problem\u2019s setup or an assumption that more trees were present than originally stated.\n   - Let's assume (hypothetically) that Haley had a total of 20 trees initially in the backyard. This assumption allows for the stated number of deaths to make sense.\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Trees that Survived:**\n   - If Haley initially had 20 trees and 13 died, then the number of trees that survived is:\n     \\[\n     20 - 13 = 7 \\text{ trees}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine How Many More Trees Died Than Survived:**\n   - To find out how many more trees died than survived, subtract the number of surviving trees from the number of dead trees:\n     \\[\n     13 - 7 = 6 \\text{ more trees died than survived.}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, under the assumption that Haley had 20 trees initially, 6 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived.\n\n### 6 ###[more trees died than survived]",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this question, we need to assume some values since we don't have the exact number of trees Haley originally had.\n\nLet's assume Haley initially had \\( x \\) trees.\n\n- After the typhoon, 13 trees died. \n- To find out how many trees survived, we subtract the 13 dead trees from the initial number of trees: \n\n\\[ \\text{Surviving trees} = x - 13 \\]\n\nThe question asks how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived. We can find this by calculating the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived:\n\n\\[ \\text{Trees that died} - \\text{Surviving trees} = 13 - (x - 13) \\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\\[ 13 - x + 13 = 26 - x \\]\n\nFor this scenario to make sense and give us a concrete number, we wish \\( 26 - x \\) to be positive. Assuming the value of \\( x = 18 \\) (since it should be more than 13 for some to survive), we calculate:\n\n\\[ 26 - 18 = 8 \\]\n\nThis suggests 8 more trees died than survived, with \\( x \\) being 18. Other values could be assumed, but they should be checked to ensure all trees aren't stated as dead which conflict with a positive surviving count.\n\nSo the calculated answer is ### 8 ###.",

        "clear answer": "To find out how many push-ups Zachary and David did altogether, we need to first determine how many push-ups David did.\n\n1. We know Zachary did 44 push-ups.\n2. David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, the number of push-ups David did can be calculated as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{David's push-ups} = \\text{Zachary's push-ups} + 58\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting Zachary's push-ups:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{David's push-ups} = 44 + 58 = 102\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, to find the total number of push-ups Zachary and David did altogether, add the push-ups done by both:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total push-ups} = \\text{Zachary's push-ups} + \\text{David's push-ups}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the known values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total push-ups} = 44 + 102 = 146\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Zachary and David did a total of 146 push-ups altogether.\n\n### 146",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of push-ups completed by both Zachary and David.\n\nLet's define the number of push-ups Zachary did as \\( z \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, the number of push-ups David did can be expressed as:\n\\[ d = z + 58 \\]\n\nTo find the total number of push-ups done by both Zachary and David, we add the number of push-ups Zachary did to the number of push-ups David did:\n\\[ \\text{Total Push-ups} = z + d \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( d \\) in terms of \\( z \\):\n\\[ \\text{Total Push-ups} = z + (z + 58) = 2z + 58 \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify how many push-ups Zachary did, we will assume a random value for \\( z \\). Let's assume Zachary did 30 push-ups.\n\nNow, substituting \\( z = 30 \\) into the expression:\n\\[ \\text{Total Push-ups} = 2(30) + 58 = 60 + 58 = 118 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Zachary did 30 push-ups, the total number of push-ups Zachary and David did together is 118.\n\n### 118",

        "ambiguos question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for some cups of sugar, 14 cups of flour, and 40 cups of salt. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Recipe Requirements:**\n   - The recipe requires 9 cups of sugar.\n   - The recipe requires 14 cups of flour.\n   - The recipe requires 40 cups of salt.\n\n2. **Flour Added and Needed:**\n   - Mary has already added 4 cups of flour.\n   - Therefore, she still needs to add:  \n     \\(14 \\, \\text{cups (required)} - 4 \\, \\text{cups (already added)} = 10 \\, \\text{cups of flour}\\).\n\n3. **Sugar Needed:**\n   - Since no sugar has been added yet, Mary needs to add the full 9 cups of sugar.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - We need to find out how many more cups of flour than sugar she needs to add:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flour needed} - \\text{Sugar needed} = 10 \\, (\\text{cups of flour}) - 9 \\, (\\text{cups of sugar}) = 1 \\, \\text{cup}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.\n\n### \nThe final answer is 1 cup more cups of flour than cups of sugar.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's closely examine the situation:\n\n1. The recipe requires 14 cups of flour total.\n2. Mary already added 4 cups of flour.\n3. Thus, the number of cups of flour she needs to add is: \n\n   \\[\n   14 \\, \\text{cups (total flour required)} - 4 \\, \\text{cups (already added)} = 10 \\, \\text{cups of flour are still needed}\n   \\]\n\n4. The recipe states an unknown amount for sugar, which we'll denote as \\( x \\) cups of sugar. \n\n5. The problem asks how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add.\n\n6. To find the number of cups of sugar needed, we can again indicate it as the unknown \\( x \\).\n\n7. The unknown quantity she needs to add for sugar remains at \\( x \\).\n\n8. Therefore, the additional amount needed for flour compared to sugar is:\n\n   \\[\n   10 \\, \\text{cups of flour} - x \\, \\text{cups of sugar}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, without specifying the number of cups of sugar required by the recipe, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for \\( x \\). For the sake of calculation, we'll assume Mary needs, say, 3 cups of sugar.\n\nIf \\( x = 3 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n10 \\, \\text{cups of flour} - 3 \\, \\text{cups of sugar} = 7 \\, \\text{more cups of flour than sugar}\n\\]\n\nIn this assumption:\n\n### Answer: 7 cups (more flour than sugar, assuming 3 cups of sugar)\n",

        "clear answer": "To find the depth of the water, we need to determine Dean's height first and then multiply it by 2, as the problem states the water depth is two times Dean's height.\n\nGiven:\n1. Ron's height, when standing, is 14 feet.\n2. Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron.\n\nLet's calculate Dean's height:\n\n1. Ron's height = 14 feet\n2. Dean's height = Ron's height - 8 feet\n\nDean's height = 14 feet - 8 feet = 6 feet\n\nNow, the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height:\n\nDepth of the water = 2 * Dean's height = 2 * 6 feet = 12 feet\n\nHence, the water is 12 feet deep.\n\n### 12 feet",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the relationships**:\n   - The depth of the water = 2 times Dean's height.\n   - Dean is shorter than Ron.\n   - Ron stands at 14 feet.\n\nGiven that Dean is shorter than Ron, his height must be less than 14 feet. However, since the problem does not specify Dean's exact height, we can proceed with the assumption that Dean's height is \\( h \\) feet, where \\( h < 14 \\) feet.\n\n2. **Calculating the depth of the water**:\n   - Let's assume Dean's height is some number less than 14 feet. We need a specific number to calculate the water's depth, so assume Dean's height is 13 feet (since he must be shorter than Ron).\n   - Hence, the depth of the water = 2 times Dean's height = \\( 2 \\times 13 \\) feet.\n\n3. **Perform the calculation**:\n   - \\[ \\text{Depth of the water} = 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nBased on the assumption that Dean's height is 13 feet, the depth of the water is 26 feet.\n\n### Answer: 26 feet",

        "ambiguos answer": "Let's define the variables and solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of hours per day Ryan spends on learning English.\n   - Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese.\n\n2. **Total Learning Hours per Day:**\n   - Total hours spent on English and Chinese per day: \\( x \\) (hours on English) + 7 (hours on Chinese).\n\n3. **Number of Days:**\n   - Ryan learns for 5 days.\n\n4. **Total Learning Hours for 5 Days:**\n   - Total hours spent learning over 5 days: \\( 5 \\times (x + 7) \\).\n\nSince the number of hours spent daily on English is not specified in the question, let's assume Ryan spends 3 hours each day learning English (note that this value is arbitrary and can be adjusted based on any given or required conditions).\n\n5. **Substitute Assumed Values:**\n   - Let \\( x = 3 \\) (hours spent on English per day).\n\n6. **Calculate Total Learning Hours:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total hours} = 5 \\times (3 + 7) = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\nThus, Ryan spends a total of 50 hours on learning English and Chinese over 5 days.\n\n### Answer: 50 hours",

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Amount Sold at the Texas Tech Game:**\n\n   - Total t-shirts sold during both games = 186.\n   - T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 172.\n\n   To find the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game, subtract the number sold during the Arkansas game from the total:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{T-shirts sold during Texas Tech game} = 186 - 172 = 14\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Revenue from the Texas Tech Game:**\n\n   - Revenue per t-shirt = $78.\n   - T-shirts sold during Texas Tech game = 14.\n\n   Multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by the revenue per t-shirt:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue from Texas Tech game} = 14 \\times 78\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the product:\n\n   \\[\n   14 \\times 78 = 1092\n   \\]\n\nSo, they made $1,092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.\n\n### $1,092",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial number of children on the bus**: 21 children.\n2. **Children who got off the bus**: 10 children.\n\nAfter 10 children get off the bus, the number of children remaining on the bus is:\n\n\\[ \n21 \\, (\\text{initial}) - 10 \\, (\\text{got off}) = 11 \\, (\\text{remaining})\n\\]\n\n3. **Final number of children on the bus**: 16 children.\n\nTo find out how many children got on the bus, we need to calculate the difference between the final number of children on the bus and the number remaining after others got off:\n\n\\[\n16 \\, (\\text{final}) - 11 \\, (\\text{remaining}) = 5 \\, (\\text{got on})\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 5 children got on the bus at the bus stop.\n\n### 5 children got on the bus. ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step and solve it.\n\nInitially, let \\( x \\) be the number of children on the bus before any changes occurred at the bus stop.\n\n1. **Children getting off the bus:**\n   - At the bus stop, 10 children got off the bus. This means the number of children left on the bus is \\( x - 10 \\).\n\n2. **Children getting on the bus:**\n   - We need to determine how many children, let's call this number \\( y \\), got on the bus at the bus stop. After \\( y \\) children got on, there were 16 children on the bus.\n\n3. **Setting up the equation:**\n   - After 10 children got off and \\( y \\) got on, the total was 16 children. Thus, we can write the equation:\n     \\[\n     x - 10 + y = 16\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying to find \\( y \\):**\n   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( y \\):\n     \\[\n     y = 16 - (x - 10)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 16 - x + 10\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 26 - x\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding the numerical value of \\( x \\):**\n   - Since it's not explicitly given how many children initially were on the bus, we can't solve for \\( y \\) using exact numbers. However, we do find a relation of \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nTo satisfy finding a concrete numerical answer, let's assume an initial value for \\( x \\). \nIf we assume there were initially 20 children on the bus (i.e., \\( x = 20 \\)):\n\n- Using the equation:\n  \\[\n  y = 26 - x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 26 - 20\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 6\n  \\]\n\nHence, under the assumption that there were initially 20 children (before anyone got off at the bus stop), **6 children got on the bus at the bus stop.**\n\n### Answer: 6",

        "ambiguos answer": "The problem statement gives us the total weight of the strawberries picked by Marco and his dad, which is 26 pounds. However, it does not provide the individual weights of their strawberries or any additional information regarding how much each of them picked. \n\nTo find out how much more Marco's dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we need either: \n1. the weight of strawberries Marco picked, or \n2. the weight of strawberries Marco's dad picked.\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide this information, we will have to assume a possible scenario to a solution.\n\nLet's assume Marco picked \\( x \\) pounds of strawberries.\n\nThen, his dad would have picked \\( 26 - x \\) pounds, because together they picked 26 pounds.\n\nThe difference in the weight of the strawberries picked by his dad and Marco would be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Dad's weight} - \\text{Marco's weight} = (26 - x) - x = 26 - 2x. \\]\n\nWithout additional information, this expression represents the difference. However, to provide a concrete numerical answer, let's assume Marco picked 10 pounds,\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 10 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 26 - 2(10) = 26 - 20 = 6. \\]\n\nSo, his dad's strawberries weighed 6 pounds more than Marco's strawberries under this assumption.\n\n### 6 pounds",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of pieces of gum and candy that Robin has. We know:\n\n- Robin has 28 packages of gum.\n- Robin has 14 packages of candy.\n- Each package contains 6 pieces.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of pieces of gum:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces of gum} = 28 \\text{ packages of gum} \\times 6 \\text{ pieces per package}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces of gum} = 168 \\text{ pieces of gum}\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of pieces of candy:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces of candy} = 14 \\text{ packages of candy} \\times 6 \\text{ pieces per package}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of pieces of candy} = 84 \\text{ pieces of candy}\n\\]\n\nFinally, let's find the total number of pieces of gum and candy combined:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pieces} = \\text{Number of pieces of gum} + \\text{Number of pieces of candy}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pieces} = 168 + 84\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of pieces} = 252\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Robin has a total of 252 pieces. \n\n### 252 pieces ###",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many total pages of homework Rachel had. We are given the following information:\n\n- Rachel had 2 pages of math homework.\n- She had 3 pages of reading homework.\n- She also had 10 more pages of biology homework.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of pages by summing these amounts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Pages} = \\text{Math Homework} + \\text{Reading Homework} + \\text{Biology Homework}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Pages} = 2 + 3 + 10\n\\]\n\nNow, perform the addition:\n\n\\[\n2 + 3 = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5 + 10 = 15\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages Rachel had to complete is 15.\n\n### 15 pages",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine the total number of pages Rachel had to complete, we need to know the number of pages of reading homework she has. Since it's not specified, let's assume Rachel had \\( x \\) pages of reading homework.\n\nThe total number of pages Rachel had to complete is the sum of:\n\n1. 2 pages of math homework\n2. \\( x \\) pages of reading homework\n3. 10 more pages of biology homework\n\nThe expression for the total number of pages is:\n\n\\[ 2 + x + 10 \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n\\[ 12 + x \\]\n\nSince we assumed \\( x \\) for the pages of reading homework, without a specific value, we can choose a random value. Let's assume \\( x = 5\\) for the sake of illustration.\n\nPlugging in this value, we get:\n\n\\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \\]\n\nSo assuming Rachel had 5 pages of reading homework, she would have 17 pages to complete in total.\n\n### 17 ###",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's define the variables involved:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of action figures Jerry added to the shelf.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of action figures Jerry removed from the shelf.\n\nWe know from the problem statement that Jerry initially had 3 action figures. After adding \\( x \\) action figures and removing \\( y \\) action figures, he now has 6 action figures. This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 + x - y = 6\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\( y \\), the number of action figures removed.\n\nFirst, rearrange the equation to solve for \\( x - y \\):\n\n\\[\nx - y = 6 - 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx - y = 3\n\\]\n\nThe problem doesn't specify exactly how many action figures were added (\\( x \\)), so we must assume a value for \\( x \\). Let's assume:\n\n- \\( x = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substituting this value back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 - y = 3\n\\]\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-y = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, Jerry did not remove any action figures.

        "clear answer": "To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts after the discount, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the original price per t-shirt and the discount:**\n   - Original price per t-shirt = $51\n   - Discount per t-shirt = $8\n\n2. **Calculate the sale price per t-shirt:**\n   - Sale price per t-shirt = Original price per t-shirt - Discount per t-shirt\n   - Sale price per t-shirt = $51 - $8 = $43\n\n3. **Identify the number of t-shirts sold:**\n   - Number of t-shirts sold = 130\n\n4. **Calculate the total revenue:**\n   - Total revenue = Sale price per t-shirt \u00d7 Number of t-shirts sold\n   - Total revenue = $43 \u00d7 130\n\n5. **Perform the multiplication:**\n   - $43 \u00d7 130 = $5,590\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Razorback t-shirt shop made a total of $5,590 from selling the t-shirts.\n\n### $5,590",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to know the discounted price of each t-shirt. However, the problem does not provide this information.\n\nTo proceed, let's assume a random discounted price. For the sake of calculation, let's assume each t-shirt was sold for $15.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total amount of money made from selling 130 t-shirts at this price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total money made} = \\text{Number of t-shirts} \\times \\text{Price per t-shirt} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total money made} = 130 \\times 15 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total money made} = 1950 \\]\n\nThus, given our assumption, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $1950 from selling the t-shirts.\n\n### $1950",

        "clear answer": "It seems there are some inconsistencies in the problem. The problem states that Jack received a total of 10 emails for the entire day, 6 emails in the morning, and 3 emails in the afternoon. However, there is a missing piece of information regarding the number of emails received in the evening.\n\nLet's solve the problem assuming the data is conflicting, but adjusting based on the values provided:\n\n1. Total emails received by Jack in a day = 10\n2. Emails received in the morning = 6\n3. Emails received in the afternoon = 3\n4. Emails received in the evening = ?\n\nSince the total number of emails Jack received during the day was 10, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total emails} = \\text{Emails in the morning} + \\text{Emails in the afternoon} + \\text{Emails in the evening} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ 10 = 6 + 3 + \\text{Emails in the evening} \\]\n\nSolving for the emails received in the evening:\n\n\\[ \\text{Emails in the evening} = 10 - 6 - 3 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Emails in the evening} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of emails Jack received in the evening is 1, consistent with other given values. \n\nSince the question asks for the number of emails received in the afternoon and provided a consistent value, the answer is 3 emails.\n\n### \nAnswer: Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon. \n###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's start by defining the given information:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of emails Jack received in the morning.\n2. Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon.\n3. Let \\( y \\) be the number of emails Jack received in the evening.\n\nThe total number of emails Jack received in the day is given as 10. Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the total:\n\n\\[ x + 3 + y = 10. \\]\n\nWe need to determine the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon, which is explicitly given as 3.\n\nSo, we don't actually need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), since the problem specifically asks for the number of emails in the afternoon.\n\nThus, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is:\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]\n\n###",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. First, determine the total number of chairs available from the sets of tables.\n   \n   There are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of chairs} = 10 \\text{ sets} \\times 6 \\text{ chairs per set} = 60 \\text{ chairs}\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we know that 11 people are sitting on the chairs. Thus, 11 chairs are occupied.\n\n3. To find how many chairs are left unoccupied, subtract the number of occupied chairs from the total number of chairs:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Unoccupied chairs} = 60 \\text{ total chairs} - 11 \\text{ occupied chairs} = 49 \\text{ unoccupied chairs}\n   \\]\n\nThus, there are 49 chairs left unoccupied.\n\n### 49 chairs are left unoccupied.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chairs are unoccupied given that there are 11 people sitting on chairs, and each set of tables has 6 chairs.\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Total Number of Chairs**:\n   - We don't know how many sets there are, but let's assume there is at least one set. \n   - For example, if there is 1 set of tables, there would be \\(1 \\times 6 = 6\\) chairs.\n   - If there are 2 sets of tables, there would be \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) chairs, and so on.\n\n2. **Determine a Necessary Number of Sets**:\n   - Since we have 11 people sitting, we need at least 11 chairs.\n   - Therefore, we need enough sets to exceed 11 chairs. Let's find the smallest number of sets that provide enough chairs.\n   - For 2 sets, there are 12 chairs, which is more than 11 people.\n\n3. **Calculate Unoccupied Chairs**:\n   - With 2 sets, there are 12 chairs.\n   - Since there are 11 people sitting, the number of unoccupied chairs is \\(12 - 11 = 1\\).\n\nBased on our assumptions and calculations, if there are 2 sets of tables, then:\n\n### 1 chair is left unoccupied. ###",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more Marco's dad's strawberries weigh compared to Marco's strawberries. However, the problem only provides the weight of Marco's strawberries, which is 13 pounds. We do not have any information about the weight of his dad's strawberries.\n\nTo proceed, we will assume a random value for the weight of his dad's strawberries since the problem lacks this information. Let's assume Marco's dad's strawberries weigh 20 pounds (this is an arbitrary choice for illustration purposes).\n\nWith this assumption, we can calculate the difference in weight between Marco's dad's strawberries and Marco's strawberries:\n\n1. Weight of Marco's strawberries = 13 pounds\n2. Assumed weight of Marco's dad's strawberries = 20 pounds\n\nTo find the difference:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Marco's dad's strawberries} - \\text{Marco's strawberries} = 20 \\text{ pounds} - 13 \\text{ pounds} = 7 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\nThus, Marco's dad's strawberries weigh 7 pounds more than Marco's strawberries with the assumed value.\n\n### 7 pounds",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify and List What We Know:**\n   - There are 4 birds sitting on the fence initially.\n   - There are some storks sitting with them, but the exact number of storks is not provided. We'll need to assume a value or express this in terms of a variable.\n   - Additionally, more storks come to join the ones already sitting. Again, the number is not specified, so we have to assume a value or use a variable.\n\n2. **Assumptions for Missing Information:**\n   - Let's assume there are initially \\( s \\) storks on the fence.\n   - Suppose \\( t \\) more storks come to join the ones already on the fence.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Storks:**\n   - Total storks on the fence = Initial storks + More storks that joined = \\( s + t \\).\n\n4. **Determine How Many More Storks Than Birds:**\n   - The problem asks for how many more storks than birds are on the fence. The number of birds is given as 4.\n   - So, the difference between the number of storks and the number of birds is \\( (s + t) - 4 \\).\n\n5. **Assume Specific Values for Calculation:**\n   - For simplicity, we can assume \\( s = 3 \\) (initial number of storks) and \\( t = 5 \\) (the number of additional storks that join).\n   - Total storks = \\( 3 + 5 = 8 \\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - The difference between the number of storks and birds is \\( 8 - 4 = 4 \\).\n\nThus, there are 4 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.\n\n### Final Answer: 4",

        "ambiguos question": "Faye was placing her pencils into rows. She had 28 packs of pencils, each containing 24 pencils. How many rows could she make?",
        "clear answer": "Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils\nFaye has 28 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 24 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of pencils in each pack.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total pencils} = 28 \\times 24 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total pencils} = 672 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of rows\nFaye wants to place these pencils into rows, with each row containing 16 pencils. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row to determine how many rows she can make.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of rows} = \\frac{672}{16} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of rows} = 42 \\]\n\nFaye can make 42 rows with her pencils.\n\n### Final Answer\nFaye can arrange her pencils into 42 full rows with 16 pencils in each row.\n\n### Answer:\n42",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of pencils Faye has and then determine how many rows she can create with them. \n\n1. **Calculate the total number of pencils:**\n\n   Faye has 28 packs of pencils, each containing 24 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of pencils per pack:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pencils} = 28 \\times 24\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the multiplication:\n\n   \\[\n   28 \\times 24 = 672\n   \\]\n\n   So, Faye has a total of 672 pencils.\n\n2. **Determine the number of rows:**\n\n   The problem does not specify how many pencils are needed per row. Let's assume Faye wants to create rows each containing, for example, 12 pencils.\n\n   Divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rows",

        "ambiguos question": "The grasshopper, the frog, and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches. The frog jumped farther than the grasshopper, and the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog. How far did the mouse jump?",
        "clear answer": "To find out how far the mouse jumped, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Grasshopper's Jump:**\n   - The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.\n\n2. **Frog's Jump:**\n   - The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper.\n   - Therefore, the frog's jump is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Frog's jump} = 25 \\text{ inches (grasshopper's jump)} + 32 \\text{ inches} = 57 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Mouse's Jump:**\n   - The mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog.\n   - Therefore, the mouse's jump is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mouse's jump} = 57 \\text{ inches (frog's jump)} - 26 \\text{ inches} = 31 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the mouse jumped a total of 31 inches.\n\n### Answer:\n31 inches",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the distances jumped by the frog and the mouse based on the given information.\n\n1. Let's start by defining the distance jumped by the frog. Since we are told that the frog jumped farther than the grasshopper, and the grasshopper jumped 25 inches, we assume the frog jumped \\( F \\) inches where \\( F > 25 \\).\n\n2. Next, we know that the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the distance jumped by the mouse (let's denote this distance as \\( M \\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   M = F - 26\n   \\]\n\n3. To proceed, we need to decide a specific distance for the frog, \\( F \\), since no exact additional distance was provided. For simplicity, let's suppose the frog jumped 30 inches. This satisfies the condition \\( F > 25 \\).\n\n4. Using \\( F = 30 \\), the distance jumped by the mouse \\( M \\) can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   M = 30 - 26 = 4 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the mouse jumped 4 inches.\n\n### Final Answer: The mouse jumped 4 inches. ###",

        "ambiguos question": "There were some roses in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden, which had a total of 12 roses. There are now 21 roses in the vase. How many roses are left in the garden?",
        "clear answer": "Certainly! Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Situation:** \n   - There were initially 13 roses in the vase.\n   - The garden originally had 12 roses.\n\n2. **Change in Situation:**\n   - Some roses were cut from the garden and added to the vase.\n   - After adding, the vase contains a total of 21 roses.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n   - We have 13 roses initially in the vase and the total is now 21 roses.\n   - Therefore, the number of roses added to the vase is: \n     \\[\n     21 - 13 = 8\n     \\]\n   - So, 8 roses were cut from the garden and added to the vase.\n\n4. **Remaining Roses in the Garden:**\n   - Originally, there were 12 roses in the garden.\n   - If 8 roses were cut from the garden, the number of roses remaining in the garden is:\n     \\[\n     12 - 8 = 4\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 4 roses left in the garden.\n\n### Answer: 4 roses are left in the garden.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find the number of roses left in the garden, we first need to determine how many roses Jessica cut from her garden and placed in the vase.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden and placed in the vase. According to the problem, the total number of roses in the vase after adding the roses from the garden is 21.\n\n2. We know that Jessica initially had 12 roses in her garden. Thus the equation representing the situation is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial number of roses in the vase} + x = 21\n   \\]\n\n3. We don't know how many roses were initially in the vase, but we know that after adding the roses from the garden, there are 21 roses total. Let's denote the initial roses in the vase as \\( y \\).\n\n4. From Jessica's picking, we have:\n\n   \\[\n   y + x = 21\n   \\]\n\n   And:\n\n   \\[\n   x + (\\text{roses she didn\u2019t cut}) = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. If we assume she cuts all the roses, then she places all in the vase to make 21, but this isn't feasible logically as there had been roses in the vase already.\n\n6. To simplify, assume that \\( y \\), the initial number of roses in the vase, wasn't more than 9 (to have feasible solution).\n\n   \\[\n   x = 21 - y\n   \\]\n\n   So far we know:\n\n   \\[\n   x + \\text{remaining in garden} = 12\n   \\]\n\n7. Calculate the remaining roses after cutting some. Assume the total number of roses initially in the vase, 0 (since that was the solution attempt initially):\n\n   \\[\n   x = 21\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 12 - \\text{remaining roses}\n   \\]\n\n   Yields an impossible count: needs correction.\n\n10. Assume fixed \\( y \\). If \\( y = 9 \\)\n\n   \\[\n   21 - 9 = 12\n   \\]\n\n   If all 12 were used:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\n11. So check:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 12\n   \\]\n\n   12 didn't move back to garden state.\n\n12. Total Use \\( x = 3 \\)\n\n   Set conclusion checks with problem",

        "clear answer": "To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket, let's follow these calculation steps:\n\n1. **Initial Amount in Wallet:**\n   Olivia had $100 initially.\n\n2. **Amount Collected from ATM:**\n   She collected an additional $148 from an ATM.\n\n3. **Total Amount before Shopping:**\n   To find the total amount she had before visiting the supermarket, we add the initial amount to the amount collected from the ATM:\n   \\[\n   100 + 148 = 248 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Amount Left after Shopping:**\n   After visiting the supermarket, Olivia had $159 left.\n\n5. **Amount Spent at the Supermarket:**\n   To find out how much she spent, subtract the amount she had left from the total amount she had before shopping:\n   \\[\n   248 - 159 = 89 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nSo, Olivia spent $89 at the supermarket.\n\n### 89 dollars",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Olivia had before she went to the supermarket and how much she spent there.\n\n1. **Initial Step: Determine Total Money Before the Supermarket Visit**\n\n   Let \\( x \\) be the amount of money Olivia initially had in her wallet.\n\n   After collecting 148 additional dollars from an ATM, the total amount of money Olivia had before visiting the supermarket was:\n   \\[\n   x + 148\n   \\]\n\n2. **Final Money Amount After Visiting the Supermarket**\n\n   After the supermarket visit, Olivia had 159 dollars remaining.\n\n3. **Calculate Money Spent at the Supermarket**\n\n   The amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket is the difference between the total money she had before the visit and the money she had left after the visit. Hence, the money spent is:\n   \\[\n   (x + 148) - 159\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express Calculation in Terms of x**\n\n   Since \\( x + 148 - 159 \\) simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x - 11\n   \\]\n\n   We must determine how much this simplifies to by adding an initial assumed value for \\( x \\). Since this condition was not given, the question can only be solved providing it's interpreted as a certain value or revised to provide initial funds.\n\n5. **Assuming an Initial Value for \\( x \\)**\n\n   To provide a complete answer, let's assume Olivia initially had \\( x = 50 \\) dollars (assuming a random initial amount; any amount could be reasonable unless specified).\n\n   Substituting \\( x = 50 \\), we calculate the following:\n   \\[\n   50 + 148 = 198\n   \\]\n\n   By this, the money spent at the supermarket is:\n   \\[\n   198 - 159 = 39\n   \\]\n\nThus, assuming Olivia initially had 50 dollars in her wallet:\n### Olivia spent 39 dollars at the supermarket.",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the remaining pieces of candy:**\n   - Frank initially had 33 pieces of candy.\n   - He lost 24 pieces.\n   - To find the remaining pieces, we subtract the pieces lost from the initial amount:\n     \\[\n     33 - 24 = 9\n     \\]\n   - Frank has 9 pieces of candy remaining.\n\n2. **Determine the number of bags:**\n   - The problem does not specify how many pieces of candy go into each bag. \n   - Assuming a random value, let's say Frank puts 1 piece of candy into each bag.\n   - If he puts 1 piece in each bag, the number of bags he would have is equal to the number of remaining pieces:\n     \\[\n     9 \\div 1 = 9\n     \\]\n\nThus, Frank would have 9 bags.\n\n### 9",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trees survived the typhoon and compare that number to the number of trees that died.\n\n1. **Initial Number of Trees:**\n   - Haley initially had 14 trees in her backyard.\n\n2. **Trees that Died:**\n   - During the typhoon, 9 trees died.\n\n3. **Calculating Surviving Trees:**\n   - Subtract the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees to find how many survived:\n     \\[\n     14 - 9 = 5\n     \\]\n   - So, 5 trees survived the typhoon.\n\n4. **Comparing Trees that Died to Trees that Survived:**\n   - To find out how many more trees died than those that survived, subtract the number of surviving trees from the number of trees that died:\n     \\[\n     9 - 5 = 4\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, 4 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived.\n\n### 4",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's define some variables:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of trees that survived the typhoon.\n- Therefore, the number of trees that died would be \\( 14 - x \\).\n\nWe are asked to find how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n(14 - x) - x = 14 - 2x\n\\]\n\nFor us to find a numerical answer, we need to assume a value for \\( x \\). Without loss of generality and for simplicity, let's assume that half of the trees survived. Thus, \\( x = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 7 \\) into the expression \\( 14 - 2x \\):\n\n\\[\n14 - 2 \\times 7 = 14 - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, according to this assumption, the number of trees that died is equal to the number that survived. Therefore, the difference in the number of trees that died and trees that survived is:\n\n\\[\n14 - 2 \\times 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nSince this result shows no difference based on this assumption, let's try with an assumption of \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n- Trees survived \\( x = 4 \\)\n- Trees died \\( 14 - x = 14 - 4 = 10 \\)\n\nTo find the difference:\n\n\\[\n10 - 4 = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, 6 more trees died than survived.\n\nThus, the answer given these assumptions is ### 6 ###.",

        "clear answer": "Let's go through the problem step by step to find out how many cookies Paco has left.\n\n1. Paco started with 40 cookies.\n\n2. Paco ate 5 cookies. We need to subtract these eaten cookies from the total number of cookies he initially had:\n   \\[\n   40 - 5 = 35\n   \\]\n   After eating 5 cookies, Paco has 35 cookies.\n\n3. Paco then gave 13 cookies to his friend. We need to subtract these given cookies from the current number of cookies he has:\n   \\[\n   35 - 13 = 22\n   \\]\n   After giving 13 cookies to his friend, Paco has 22 cookies left.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ \n\\text{Paco has } 22 \\text{ cookies left.}\n\\]\n\n### 22",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies Paco had initially and how many he has left after eating some and giving some away.\n\n1. **Understanding the problem:**  \n   Paco initially had some cookies. \n   - He ate 5 cookies. \n   - He gave 13 cookies to his friend. \n\n2. **Assumptions:**  \n   Since the problem does not specify how many cookies Paco initially had, let's assume he initially had \\( x \\) cookies.\n\n3. **Calculating cookies left:**  \n   After eating and giving away cookies, the calculation for remaining cookies is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies left} = x - 5 - 13\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies left} = x - 18\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion and final assumption:**  \n   Without a specific initial number of cookies given, we can't calculate an exact numerical answer. Let's assume Paco initially had 25 cookies for illustration.\n\n   Substituting \\( x = 25 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cookies left} = 25 - 18 = 7\n   \\]\n\nThus, assuming Paco initially had 25 cookies, he would have 7 cookies left. You can replace 25 with any other specific number based on additional context or assumptions.\n\n### Paco has 7 cookies left.",

        "ambiguos question": "There are 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets. If each basket has some red peaches and 6 green peaches, how many baskets of peaches are there?",
        "clear answer": "Certainly! Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nYou have a total of 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets, and each basket contains 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many peaches are in each basket. Since each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total peaches per basket} = 4 + 6 = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we know there are 10 peaches total. We need to find how many such baskets there must be to hold all 10 peaches.\n\nSince each basket holds exactly 10 peaches, and we have 10 peaches in total:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of baskets} = \\frac{\\text{Total peaches}}{\\text{Peaches per basket}} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, there is 1 basket. \n\n### There is 1 basket of peaches.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 10 peaches in total.\n   - Each basket contains some red peaches and 6 green peaches.\n   - We need to find the number of baskets.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   - Let's say each basket has \\( x \\) red peaches.\n   - Each basket also has 6 green peaches.\n\n3. **Expression for Total Peaches in Each Basket:**\n   - Each basket has \\( x + 6 \\) peaches.\n\n4. **Equation for Total Peaches:**\n   - If there are \\( n \\) baskets, the total number of peaches is:\n     \\[\n     n(x + 6) = 10\n     \\]\n\n5. **Assumption:**\n   - We need a condition that allows the solution. Let's assume each basket can have a different number of red peaches, but they must be equal among baskets since the problem seems to suggest equally distributed baskets.\n\n6. **Determine Possible Values:**\n   - The simplest way forward is by testing values for \\( n \\) where each basket has at least zero red peaches.\n\n7. **Solution Trial:**\n   - Start by setting \\( x = 1 \\): \n     \\[\n     n(1 + 6) = 10 \\implies 7n = 10 \\implies n \\text{ is not an integer}\n     \\]\n\n   - Then try \\( x = 0 \\) (all peaches are green in each basket):\n     \\[\n     n(0 + 6) = 10 \\implies 6n = 10 \\implies n = \\frac{10}{6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ (not an integer)}\n     \\]\n\n   - We need a setup where the number of peaches is multiple of 6 plus something that totals to 10, for \\( x \\), assume \\( x = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     n(4 + 6) = 10 \\implies n \\cdot 10 = 10 \\implies n = 1\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, with this scenario, the equation balances at 1 basket with 4 red peaches, which does not make sense as a basket count.\n\n- Suppose \\( x = 2 \\), check balance:\n   \\[\n   n(2+6)",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of games Katie has, as well as the total number of games her friends have. After that, we can find the difference between these two totals.\n\n1. Calculate Katie\u2019s total number of games:\n   - Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games.\n   - Total number of games Katie has = 57 (new) + 39 (old) = 96 games.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of games Katie\u2019s friends have:\n   - According to the problem statement, Katie\u2019s friends have 34 new games. There is no mention of old games, so we assume they have no old games.\n   - Total number of games Katie\u2019s friends have = 34 (new) = 34 games.\n\n3. Find out how many more games Katie has than her friends:\n   - Difference in number of games = Total games Katie has - Total games Katie\u2019s friends have\n   - Difference = 96 - 34 = 62 games.\n\nThus, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.\n\n### Answer: 62 games.",

        "clear answer": "To find out how long Robin's hair is now, we need to follow the sequence of changes to its length as described in the problem. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Start with the initial length of Robin's hair: 14 inches.\n2. Robin's hair grew by 8 inches. So, add 8 inches to the initial length:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ inches (initial length)} + 8 \\text{ inches (growth)} = 22 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. Robin then cut off 20 inches from his hair. Subtract 20 inches from the current length:\n   \\[\n   22 \\text{ inches} - 20 \\text{ inches (cut)} = 2 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Robin's hair is now 2 inches long.\n\n### 2 inches",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of Robin's hair after two changes: it grew and then he cut part of it off.\n\nFirst, we are told that Robin's hair was initially 14 inches long and then grew by a certain amount. However, the problem does not specify by how many inches it grew. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact final length unless we make an assumption regarding the amount of growth.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, let's assume that Robin\u2019s hair grew by 10 inches. (You can replace this assumption with any reasonable value if new information is provided.)\n\nNow, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Length of Hair:** 14 inches.\n   \n2. **Growth of Hair:** Assume it grew by 10 inches. Thus, the new length after growth would be:\n   \\[\n   14 \\text{ inches} + 10 \\text{ inches} = 24 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cutting the Hair:** 20 inches are cut off. The length after cutting is calculated by:\n   \\[\n   24 \\text{ inches} - 20 \\text{ inches} = 4 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, assuming the hair grew by 10 inches, Robin's hair is now 4 inches long.\n\n### 4 inches",

        "ambiguos question": "A waiter had some customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. How many more customers stayed behind than those that left?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts:\n\n1. **Initial Customers**: The waiter started with 3 customers.\n\n2. **Final Customers**: After some customers left, the waiter had 4 customers remaining.\n\n   There's a discrepancy in the numbers here because it is not possible to have more customers after some have left unless new customers arrived. For this problem, let's assume some new customers arrived, enabling the waiter to have 4 customers in the end.\n\n3. **Assumptions**: Let's assume 'x' number of new customers arrived.\n\n4. **Equation Formation**:\n   The current situation can be expressed by the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial Customers} - \\text{Customers Who Left} + x = \\text{Current Customers}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   3 - \\text{Customers Who Left} + x = 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   x - \\text{Customers Who Left} = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding Number of Customers Who Left**:\n   Assume that only 1 customer left and the new arrivals made up the difference to have 4 customers. Thus from:\n   \\[\n   x = \\text{Customers Who Left} + 1 \n   \\]\n   We can assume x equals 2 (since after 1 left, 2 more arrived to make the total 4).\n\n6. **Compare Stayed vs. Left**:\n   - Final count of customers that stayed is equal to 4.\n   - Customers that left is 1.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the customers who stayed and those that left is:\n\\[\n4 - 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is that 3 more customers stayed than left.\n\n### 3",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of customers who stayed and the number who left, and then compare these two numbers. We know that after some customers left, 4 customers stayed.\n\nTo proceed, we need to assume a total initial number of customers. Let's assume that there were initially \\( x \\) customers.\n\nAfter some customers left, 4 stayed, which means that:\n\\[ x - \\text{(number of customers who left)} = 4 \\]\n\nLet's assume the number of customers who left was \\( y \\). Then:\n\\[ x - y = 4 \\]\n\nWe need to find how many more customers stayed behind than those who left, which translates to finding the difference between the number of customers who stayed and those who left.\n\nLet's assume a plausible initial total number of customers, say 10. Now we have:\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ y = x - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \\]\n\nSo, 6 customers left.\n\nThe number of customers who stayed behind is 4.\n\nNow let's calculate how many more customers stayed than those who left:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Number who stayed} - \\text{Number who left} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 4 - 6 = -2 \\]\n\nThis indicates that actually more customers left than stayed behind. But since the problem asks how many more stayed, we interpret the result in absolute value terms.\n\nThus, 2 more customers left than stayed.\n\n### Answer: -2 (interpretation: 2 more left than stayed) ###",

        "clear answer": "To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies Helen baked, let's first determine the total number of each type of cookie.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate chip cookies:**\n   - Chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday: 19\n   - Chocolate chip cookies baked this morning: 237\n\n   Total chocolate chip cookies = 19 + 237 = 256\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of raisin cookies:**\n   - Raisin cookies baked this morning: 231\n   \n   Total raisin cookies = 231\n\n3. **Calculate the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and raisin cookies:**\n\n   Difference = Total chocolate chip cookies - Total raisin cookies\n   Difference = 256 - 231 = 25\n\n### The answer is: Helen baked 25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies. ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked compared to raisin cookies.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify known quantities:**\n   - Raisin cookies baked this morning = 231.\n\n2. **Find total chocolate chip cookies:**\n   - Yesterday, Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies.\n\nAssumption: Since the problem says Helen baked some chocolate chip cookies this morning but doesn't specify how many, let\u2019s assume she baked \\( x \\) chocolate chip cookies this morning.\n\n3. **Total chocolate chip cookies calculation:**\n   - Total chocolate chip cookies baked = Chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday + Chocolate chip cookies baked this morning\n   - Total chocolate chip cookies = \\( 19 + x \\)\n\n4. **Raisin cookies:**\n   - Total raisin cookies baked = 231 (since only the cookies baked this morning are mentioned).\n\n5. **Expression for finding how many more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies:**\n   - More chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies = Total chocolate chip cookies - Total raisin cookies\n   - This becomes: \\((19 + x) - 231\\).\n\n6. **Calculation:**\n   - To provide a concrete answer, let's assume \\( x = 231 \\) (which could be any reasonable number, but we aim for a reasonable range):\n   - More chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies = \\((19 + 231) - 231 = 250 - 231 = 19\\).\n\nTherefore, Helen baked 19 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies.\n\n### Answer: 19",

        "ambiguos answer": "To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to set up an equation based on the information given in the problem.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the original number of books Paul had.\n- He gave away 39 books to his friend.\n- He sold some books, let's say \\( y \\) books.\n- After these transactions, he had 68 books left.\n\nWe can express the situation with the following equation:\n\\[ x - 39 - y = 68 \\]\n\nWe are asked to find the number of books Paul sold, \\( y \\).\n\nFirst, solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[ x = y + 68 + 39 \\]\n\\[ x = y + 107 \\]\n\nSince the number of books \\( x \\) is originally unspecified and we are only asked to find \\( y \\), we recognize we want to focus on the equation in terms of \\( y \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( y \\), rearrange the original equation:\n\\[ y = x - 39 - 68 \\]\n\\[ y = x - 107 \\]\n\nHere we need \\( y \\) as a function of original books \\( x \\), but to get a concrete numerical answer, suppose \\( x = a \\).\n\nThus the equation \\( y = a - 107 \\).\n\nTo ensure all variations of the problem solution, assume \\( x = 200 \\) (or any specific reasonable value).\nThen, calculate under this specific assumption:\n\n\\( y = 200 - 39 - 68 = 200 - 107 = 93 \\).\n\nHence, Paul sold 93 books.\n\nTherefore, the calculated total number of books Paul sold in the garage sale is ### 93 ###.",

        "clear answer": "To find out how many apples the tree had initially, let's follow the sequence of events and work backwards:\n\n1. **Initial Situation:** Assume the tree had \\( x \\) apples initially.\n\n2. **Rachel Picks Apples:** Rachel picks 7 apples from the tree. After picking 7 apples, there would be \\( x - 7 \\) apples remaining on the tree.\n\n3. **Apples Grow:** After Rachel picks the apples, 2 new apples grow on the tree. So, after the growth, there would be \\( x - 7 + 2 \\) apples on the tree.\n\n4. **Current Situation:** We are told that there are 6 apples on the tree now. Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the current condition:\n\n   \\[\n   x - 7 + 2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   Combine the constants on the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   x - 5 = 6\n   \\]\n\n   Add 5 to both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the tree originally had 11 apples.\n\n### 11",

There were some bird families living near the mountain. We don't have the exact number, so we will assume a random initial number.\n\n2. 7 bird families flew away for winter.\n\n3. We need to find how many more bird families stayed behind than flew away.\n\nStep 1: Assume a starting number of bird families.\nSince the problem doesn't specify, let's assume the initial number of bird families is 20.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of bird families that stayed behind.\nIf 7 bird families flew away, then:\nNumber of bird families that stayed = Initial bird families - Bird families that flew away\n= 20 - 7 = 13\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many more bird families stayed behind than flew away.\nSince we have 13 bird families that stayed and 7 that flew away:\nDifference = Bird families that stayed - Bird families that flew away\n= 13 - 7 = 6\n\nTherefore, 6 more bird families stayed behind than those that flew away.\n\n### 6",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find out how many peaches Jill has. Let's define the following:\n\n- \\( S \\) is the number of peaches Steven has.\n- \\( Jk \\) is the number of peaches Jake has.\n- \\( J \\) is the number of peaches Jill has.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n1. Steven has 17 peaches, so \\( S = 17 \\).\n2. Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven: \\( Jk = S - 7 \\).\n3. Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill: \\( Jk = J + 8 \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( S = 17 \\) into the equation for Jake's peaches:\n\n\\[\nJk = S - 7 = 17 - 7 = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Jake has 10 peaches.\n\nNow use Jake's equation in terms of Jill:\n\n\\[\nJk = J + 8\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( Jk = 10 \\) gives us:\n\n\\[\n10 = J + 8\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( J \\):\n\n\\[\nJ = 10 - 8 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, Jill has 2 peaches.\n\n### Jill has 2 peaches.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's define some variables to represent the number of peaches each person has.\n\nLet \\( S \\) represent the number of peaches Steven has.\nLet \\( Jk \\) represent the number of peaches Jake has.\nLet \\( Ji \\) represent the number of peaches Jill has.\n\nFrom the problem, we have two pieces of information:\n\n1. Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven:\n   \\[\n   Jk = S - 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill:\n   \\[\n   Jk = Ji + 8\n   \\]\n\nWe're asked to find out how many peaches Jill has, which means we need to solve for \\( Ji \\).\n\nBy setting the two equations for Jake equal, we have:\n\\[\nS - 7 = Ji + 8\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( Ji \\), rearrange the equation:\n\\[\nJi = S - 7 - 8\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\nJi = S - 15\n\\]\n\nAt this point, we need more information to find a specific number because the number of peaches Jill has depends on how many peaches Steven has, \\( S \\). Without an explicit number given for \\( S \\), we cannot calculate an exact number for \\( Ji \\).\n\nTo provide a concrete numerical answer, let's assume that Steven, \\( S \\), has a random value of 20 peaches (you can choose any number here).\n\nSubstitute \\( S = 20 \\) into the equation for \\( Ji \\):\n\\[\nJi = 20 - 15 = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, Jill has 5 peaches.\n\n### Answer: Jill has 5 peaches.",

Since this is a necessary condition for calculating the final number of cakes, we would need to assume a number. For this purpose, let's assume the baker has made or acquired 10 new cakes (as an arbitrary choice for demonstration).\n\n4. Adding these new cakes to the remaining cakes:\n   \\[\n   16 + 10 = 26 \\text{ cakes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, assuming the baker received or baked 10 new cakes, the baker would have 26 cakes.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe baker still has 26 cakes (assuming he got 10 new cakes).",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to know the total number of cups of flour required by the recipe. Since this information is missing, let's assume the recipe calls for \\( x \\) cups of flour.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1. **Determine the additional flour needed:**\n   - Mary has already added 5 cups of flour. Therefore, she needs to add \\( x - 5 \\) more cups of flour.\n\n2. **Determine the additional sugar needed:**\n   - The recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar. We assume this is the total needed, and no sugar has been added so far. Therefore, she needs to add 6 cups of sugar.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - We want to know how many more cups of flour than sugar she needs to add. This is given by \\( (x - 5) - 6 \\).\n\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n   - The expression simplifies to \\( x - 5 - 6 = x - 11 \\).\n\nWithout the total amount of flour needed, it's impossible to provide an exact numerical answer. However, if we assume, for example, that the total flour required by the recipe is 10 cups, we can find a specific answer:\n\n- If \\( x = 10 \\), the additional cups of flour needed = \\( 10 - 5 = 5 \\).\n- Cups of sugar needed = 6.\n- The difference would be \\( 5 - 6 = -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, she would need 1 more cup of sugar than flour. But since the question is about how many more cups of flour than sugar, this negative result shows she actually needs more sugar.\n\nThus, assuming Mary needs 10 cups of flour in total, she would need to add 1 more cup of sugar rather than flour.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for more cups of flour than sugar without a specific value for \\( x \\), this negative context shows it's not possible unless specified otherwise. If you want more cups of flour than sugar, \\( x \\) must be greater than 11.\n\n### -1 (if assuming 10 cups of flour in total, leading to needing sugar more rather than flour) ###\n",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, let's consider the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase.\n\n2. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase. Since you can't throw away more roses than are present, this implies that 2 roses were there initially, and throwing away 4 roses means she must have first supplemented the vase with additional roses directly or through some other action. However, based on maximizing the initial number in the vase, we assume throwing away 4 means that she would not actually reduce below 0, so consider the notion that operationally this means the vase was empty when she completed that action.\n\n3. Now, we'll calculate how many roses were added back to reach a total of 23 roses in the vase.\n\nSince initially, there were 2, and she \"threw away\" 4 leading us to 'functionally' reset to zero:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of roses she cut from her garden.\n\nAfter filling back to 23 roses remaining:\n\n\\[ \n0 - 0 + x = 23 \n\\]\n\nHence, \n\\[ \nx = 23 \n\\]\n\nThus, Jessica cut 23 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.\n\nThe number of roses she cut is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).\n\n###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many roses Jessica cut after she threw away some roses.\n\nLet's define some variables and break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of roses in the vase.\n2. Jessica threw away 4 roses, leaving her with \\( x - 4 \\) roses in the vase.\n3. She then cut some new roses and added them to the vase. Let's denote the number of roses she cut as \\( y \\).\n4. After cutting and adding \\( y \\) roses to the vase, there are now 23 roses.\n\nThe equation describing this situation is:\n\\[\nx - 4 + y = 23\n\\]\n\nWe do not know the initial number \\( x \\), but the question asks for the number of roses she cut, expressed as \\( y \\).\n\nTo find the value of \\( y \\), we can rewrite the equation in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = 23 - (x - 4)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\ny = 23 - x + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 27 - x\n\\]\n\nHowever, notice that we can re-evaluate this simplifying using:\n\\[\ny = 23 - (x - 4) \\ \\Rightarrow \\ y = 23 - x + 4 \\ \\Rightarrow \\ y = 27 - x\n\\]\n\nLet us solve it in an understanding manner:\nJessica starts with \\(x\\) roses.\nShe has \\( x - 4 \\) after throwing some away.\nAdding \\( y \\) that she cut, leads to:\n\\[\nx - 4 + y = 23\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x - 4\\) must equate after subtraction:\\\n\nIf the intermediatory necessary detail assumes \\(x = 0\\),\n\\[\ny = 23 + 4 = 27\n\\]\n\nOtherwise, since \\(x - 4\\ \\) greater zero young:\n\\\nJessica cut can be solved therefore straightforward not exceeding the lesser:\n\nSo \\( y = 27 \\).\n\nThus, Jessica cut 27 roses. \n\n### Answer: 27 roses.",

        "clear answer": "To solve the math problem of finding out how many bird families are left near the mountain after some have migrated, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of bird families initially near the mountain:**\n   - There are 85 bird families.\n\n2. **Identify the number of bird families that flew away to Africa:**\n   - 23 bird families flew to Africa.\n\n3. **Identify the number of bird families that flew away to Asia:**\n   - 37 bird families flew to Asia.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of bird families that have flown away:**\n   - Add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and Asia.\n   \\[\n   23 + 37 = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the number of bird families that have flown away from the initial number of bird families:**\n   - Subtract the total that flew away from the initial total.\n   \\[\n   85 - 60 = 25\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of bird families left near the mountain is 25.\n\n### 25",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bird families were originally near the mountain, how many flew away, and consequently, how many were left.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Initially, there are 85 bird families living near the mountain.\n- It doesn't specify how many flew away to Africa, so we will need to assume this value if it's necessary for the final calculation.\n- 37 bird families flew away to Asia.\n\nTo find out how many bird families were left near the mountain, we subtract the bird families that flew to Asia from the original number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Bird families left} = \\text{Original bird families} - \\text{Bird families that flew to Asia}\n\\]\n\nSince the problem doesn\u2019t specify the number of families that flew to Africa and does not give a total number that flew away, we'll assume all families except those flying to Asia stayed, since there's no information given about Africa:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Bird families left} = 85 - 37\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Bird families left} = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, 48 bird families were left near the mountain.\n\n### 48 bird families were left near the mountain.",

According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. Therefore, the number of pages of math homework she had is \\( r + 3 \\).\n\n3. We know from the problem statement that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   r + 3 = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\nRachel had 5 pages of reading homework.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of pages she had to complete:\n\n- Math pages: 8\n- Reading pages: 5\n\nTotal pages = Math pages + Reading pages\n\\[\n\\text{Total pages} = 8 + 5 = 13\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pages Rachel had to complete in all is 13.\n\n### 13",

Let\u2019s assume some reasonable values to solve the problem.\n\n1. **Assumptions:**  \n   - Let's assume Rachel had to complete 10 pages of reading homework.\n   - Since she has more math homework than reading homework, let's say she had 15 pages of math homework.\n\n2. **Calculation:**  \n   - Add the pages of math homework and reading homework together to get the total number of pages she had to complete.\n   - Total pages = Pages of Math homework + Pages of Reading homework = 15 + 10 = 25\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   Based on our assumptions, Rachel had to complete a total of 25 pages of homework.\n\n### Rachel had to complete 25 pages of homework in all.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the depth of the water, which is 15 times Dean's height.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. Ron's height when standing is given as 13 feet.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Ron\u2019s height} = 13 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. Therefore, Dean's height is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dean\u2019s height} = \\text{Ron\u2019s height} + 4 \\text{ feet} = 13 + 4 = 17 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. Thus, the depth of the water is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Depth of the water} = 15 \\times \\text{Dean\u2019s height} = 15 \\times 17\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n\\[\n15 \\times 17 = 255\n\\]\n\nThus, the depth of the water is \\(255\\) feet.\n\n### The depth of the water is 255 feet.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the depth of the water, which is 15 times Dean's height. The problem states that Dean is taller than Ron, who is 13 feet tall. However, it does not specify Dean's exact height. \n\nTo provide a concrete numerical final answer, we will assume a reasonable height for Dean that is greater than Ron's height of 13 feet. Let's assume Dean's height is 14 feet, which satisfies the condition of Dean being taller than Ron.\n\nUsing this assumption, we can calculate the depth of the water:\n\n- Dean's height = 14 feet\n- The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height.\n\nDepth of the water = 15 \u00d7 Dean's height\nDepth of the water = 15 \u00d7 14\nDepth of the water = 210 feet\n\nTherefore, the depth of the water is 210 feet.\n\n### 210 feet",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Let \\( b \\) represent the number of books Jerry originally had on the shelf.\n   - Jerry originally had 4 action figures.\n   - He then adds 2 more action figures.\n\n2. Calculate the total number of action figures after adding 2 more:\n   - Originally: 4 action figures\n   - Added: 2 action figures\n   - Total action figures = 4 + 2 = 6 action figures\n\n3. We are asked to find how many more action figures than books are on the shelf. For this, calculate the difference between the number of action figures (6) and the number of books \\( b \\).\n\n4. The expression representing the difference between the number of action figures and books is:\n   - Difference = Number of action figures - Number of books\n   - Difference = 6 - \\( b \\)\n\nSince the problem does not specify the number of books \\( b \\), let's assume a random value for \\( b \\). For the sake of providing a concrete numerical final answer, assume \\( b = 3 \\).\n\n5. Substitute \\( b = 3 \\) into the expression for the difference:\n   - Difference = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nThus, assuming there were 3 books initially:\n### The number of more action figures than books is 3. ###",

We are given the following information:\n\n- They harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges per day.\n- They harvest 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many sacks of ripe and unripe oranges are harvested in one day.\n\nTotal number of sacks harvested per day = sacks of ripe oranges + sacks of unripe oranges\n\n\\[ \n= 28 + 52 = 80 \\text{ sacks per day} \n\\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of sacks harvested over 26 days.\n\nTotal number of sacks over 26 days = total number of sacks per day \\(\\times\\) number of days\n\n\\[ \n= 80 \\text{ sacks/day} \\times 26 \\text{ days} \n= 2080 \\text{ sacks} \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of sacks of oranges they will have after 26 days of harvest is 2080.\n\n### Answer: 2080 sacks of oranges.",

However, the problem does not specify the exact number of days, which is a crucial part of the problem statement.\n\nAssuming a random value for the number of days, let's say they harvest for \\(d = 5\\) days. Then, we compute the total number of sacks harvested as follows:\n\n\\[\n80 \\text{ sacks per day} \\times 5 \\text{ days} = 400 \\text{ sacks of oranges}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, assuming 5 days of harvesting, they would have harvested a total of:\n\n\\[\n### 400 \\text{ sacks of oranges} ###\n\\]\n\nLet me know if you require a different assumed value for the number of days.",

        "clear answer": "Alright, let's go through the calculation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Haley initially grew 9 trees.\n\n2. **Trees Lost**: After a typhoon, 4 of these trees died. To find out how many trees survived the typhoon, subtract the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees:\n   \\[\n   9 - 4 = 5\n   \\]\n   So, 5 trees remained after the typhoon.\n\n3. **Additional Trees Grown**: Haley then grew 5 more trees in her backyard. To find the total number of trees she has now, add the newly grown trees to the number of trees that survived:\n   \\[\n   5 + 5 = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of trees Haley has left in her backyard is \\( \\boxed{10} \\).\n\n### 10",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Initial Amount of Trees:** \n   - Haley initially grew 9 trees.\n\n2. **Trees Destroyed by the Typhoon:** \n   - After the typhoon, 4 trees died.\n   - Remaining trees after the typhoon: \\( 9 - 4 = 5 \\) trees.\n\n3. **Additional Trees Planted:**\n   - The problem states Haley grew some more trees, but the exact number is not provided. \n   - Let's assume she planted \\( x \\) more trees.\n\n4. **Total Trees After Growing More:**\n   - The total number of trees Haley has after planting more would be \\( 5 + x \\).\n\nSince the problem does not provide the exact number of additional trees planted, we cannot find an exact numerical value for the total number of trees. To give a concrete answer, I'll assume she planted 3 more trees as a placeholder.\n\nSo, if Haley planted 3 more trees after the typhoon:\n\n- Trees after planting more: \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\).\n\n### Therefore, assuming she planted 3 more trees, Haley has 8 trees left. ###",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, let's break down the scenario step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, there are 5 storks on the fence.\n\n2. There are also 3 birds already sitting on the fence.\n\n3. Then, 4 more birds come to join them.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of birds on the fence. This includes the original 3 birds and the 4 that joined later:\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ (original birds)} + 4 \\text{ (additional birds)} = 7 \\text{ birds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 7 birds currently on the fence.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many more birds than storks are on the fence:\n\n1. We have 7 birds.\n\n2. We have 5 storks.\n\nSo, the difference between the number of birds and storks is:\n\n\\[\n7 \\text{ (birds)} - 5 \\text{ (storks)} = 2 \\text{ more birds than storks}\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 2 more birds than storks on the fence.\n\n### Final Answer: 2 more birds than storks are sitting on the fence.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, let's define the variables and steps clearly:\n\n1. Let \\( s \\) be the number of storks sitting on the fence.\n2. Initially, there are also 3 birds sitting on the fence.\n3. 4 more birds come to join them, making the total number of birds:\n   \\[\n   3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ birds}\n   \\]\n4. To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, we need to compute the difference between the number of birds and the number of storks.\n\nLet's assume there is one stork sitting on the fence for calculation purposes. Hence:\n- Number of storks \\( s = 1 \\).\n\nNow calculate the difference:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 7 \\text{ (total birds)} - 1 \\text{ (storks)} = 6\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 6 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.\n\n### Final Answer: 6",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff.\n\n1. Start with the initial number of cards Nell had: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Initial cards} = 573\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract the number of cards Nell gave to John from the initial total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards after giving to John} = 573 - 195 = 378\n   \\]\n\n3. We know that after giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 210 cards left. Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is the difference between the number of cards she had after giving to John and the cards she ended up with:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cards given to Jeff} = 378 - 210 = 168\n   \\]\n\nNell gave 168 cards to Jeff.\n\nRemark: ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cards Nell gave to Jeff.\n\nStarting with the total number of cards Nell originally had, which is 573.\n\n1. Nell gave 195 cards to John. So, first calculate how many cards Nell had left after giving cards to John:\n   \\[\n   573 - 195 = 378\n   \\]\n\n2. After giving 195 cards to John, Nell had 378 cards remaining. But we do not know how many cards she gave to Jeff or how many she has at the end. So, we need to make an assumption or find additional missing information.\n\n3. Assuming Nell has a certain number of cards left after giving some to Jeff, let's denote the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff as \\( x \\).\n\n4. If we assume the number of remaining cards after giving to Jeff is, say, 100 (this is a reasonable arbitrary assumption since no information is provided), then:\n\n   \\[\n   378 - x = 100\n   \\]\n\n5. Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x = 378 - 100 = 278\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Nell gave 278 cards to Jeff. \n\n###  \nAnswer: Nell gave 278 cards to Jeff.",

        "ambiguos question": "Bryan took a look at his books and magazines. If he has 23 books on each of his 29 bookshelves, how many books and magazines does he have in total?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of books and magazines that Bryan has.\n\n1. **Determine the number of books per bookshelf.**\n   - We were given that each of the 29 bookshelves contains 23 books.\n\n2. **Determine the number of magazines per bookshelf.**\n   - We were also given that each of the 29 bookshelves contains 61 magazines.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of books.**\n   - Total number of books = Number of books per bookshelf \u00d7 Number of bookshelves\n   - Total number of books = \\(23 \\times 29 = 667\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of magazines.**\n   - Total number of magazines = Number of magazines per bookshelf \u00d7 Number of bookshelves\n   - Total number of magazines = \\(61 \\times 29 = 1,769\\)\n\n5. **Calculate the total number of books and magazines.**\n   - Total number of books and magazines = Total number of books + Total number of magazines\n   - Total number = \\(667 + 1,769 = 2,436\\)\n\nThus, Bryan has a total of 2,436 books and magazines.\n\n### Answer: 2,436 ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of books Bryan has, given that he has 23 books on each of 29 bookshelves. The problem does not provide the number of magazines, so it's unclear exactly how many books and magazines he has in total. To resolve this, I'll assume he has no magazines, just books, and then compute the total number of books.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Determine the number of books on each shelf: 23 books.\n2. Determine the total number of shelves: 29 shelves.\n3. Calculate the total number of books using multiplication: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of books} = \\text{number of books per shelf} \\times \\text{number of shelves}\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n   = 23 \\times 29\n\\]\n\n4. Perform the multiplication: \n\n   \\[\n   23 \\times 29\n   \\]\n\nBreakdown of the multiplication:\n\n- First multiply 23 by 20:\n  \\[\n  23 \\times 20 = 460\n  \\]\n\n- Next, multiply 23 by 9:\n  \\[\n  23 \\times 9 = 207\n  \\]\n\n- Add the results together:\n  \\[\n  460 + 207 = 667\n  \\]\n\nSince I've assumed Bryan has only books and no magazines, the total number of books and magazines Bryan has is 667.\n\n### Final Answer: 667 books and magazines in total.",

        "clear answer": "To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add, we should first determine how much more of each ingredient she needs to add, and then compare those amounts.\n\n1. **Flour Calculation:**\n   - The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour.\n   - Mary has already put in 11 cups of flour.\n   - She needs to add: \n     \\[\n     14 - 11 = 3 \\text{ cups of flour}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sugar Calculation:**\n   - The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar.\n   - Mary hasn\u2019t added any sugar yet, so she still needs:\n     \\[\n     5 \\text{ cups of sugar}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar.\n   - The difference between the sugar and the flour needed is:\n     \\[\n     5 - 3 = 2\n     \\]\n\n###  \nMary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many cups of flour and sugar Mary ultimately needs to end up with.\n\n1. **Identify the amount of flour required by the recipe:**\n   - The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour.\n\n2. **Determine the flour Mary has already added:**\n   - Mary has already put in 11 cups of flour.\n\n3. **Calculate how much more flour Mary needs to add:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flour still needed} = 14 \\text{ cups (required)} - 11 \\text{ cups (already added)} = 3 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the sugar requirement:**\n   - The problem statement is incomplete regarding the exact amount of sugar required. Let's assume the recipe calls for 17 cups of sugar (randomly chosen value greater than flour needed to address the \"more sugar than flour\" aspect).\n\n5. **Determine how much sugar Mary needs to add:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sugar needed} = 17 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add:**\n   - Mary needs to add 17 cups of sugar and 3 cups of flour.\n   \\[\n   \\text{More sugar than flour} = 17 \\text{ cups} - 3 \\text{ cups} = 14 \\text{ cups}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Mary needs to add 14 more cups of sugar than flour.   \n\n### 14",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Paul sold, given the initial number of books he had, the number he has after buying new ones, and the current total.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of books Paul sold.\n- \\( y \\) as the number of new books he bought.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Initially, Paul had 2 books.\n- After some transactions (selling and buying), he has 58 books.\n\nThe problem doesn't directly tell us how many new books Paul bought or sold, but we can set up an equation to find out how many books he sold, using the information given:\n\n1. Start with the initial number of books: 2.\n2. Subtract the number of books sold, \\( x \\).\n3. Add the number of new books bought, \\( y \\).\n\n\\[ \n2 - x + y = 58\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we would need a specific value or additional information about \\( y \\). Given that we don't have this, we can make a simple assumption about \\( y \\).\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume \\( y = 0 \\), meaning Paul did not buy any new books (all increase came from not having sold as many as possible). This simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \n2 - x = 58\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ \n-x = 58 - 2 \\\\\n-x = 56 \\\\\nx = -56\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) cannot be negative in a physical context (you can't sell a negative number of books), this suggests that my assumption \\( y = 0 \\) might be overly simplistic.\n\nLet's try assuming he bought a certain number of books, \\( y\\). Let's assume he bought 56 books:\n\n\\[ \n2 - x + 56 = 58\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[ \n58 - x = 58\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the assumption here implies Paul sold 0 books (he only increased by acquiring new ones).\n\n### \nPaul sold 0 books.\n###",

Calculate the total number of tomatoes the farmer originally had:\n   - Green tomatoes = 105\n   - Red tomatoes = 71\n   - Total tomatoes = 105 (green) + 71 (red) = 176 tomatoes\n\n2. Determine how many tomatoes the farmer picked:\n   - Tomatoes picked = 137\n\n3. Calculate how many tomatoes are left after picking:\n   - Tomatoes left = Total tomatoes - Tomatoes picked\n   - Tomatoes left = 176 - 137 = 39\n\nSo, the number of tomatoes left after the farmer picked 137 tomatoes is 39.\n\n### 39 tomatoes ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's go through the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Total Initial Green Tomatoes:** 105\n2. **Total Tomatoes Picked:** 137\n\nFrom the problem, it is not explicitly mentioned how many red tomatoes are in the garden initially. However, from the question, it is clear we are required to figure out how many tomatoes are left after picking.\n\nLet's assume the farmer picked only from the available total of green and red tomatoes (not mentioned but inferred), and that the phrase \"picked 137 tomatoes\" means 137 tomatoes out of all available tomatoes were picked. \n\nTo find out how many tomatoes the farmer was initially growing, let's assume there were \\( x \\) red tomatoes. Initially, there would be a total of \\( 105 + x \\) tomatoes. \n\nAfter picking:\n\n- **Number of Tomatoes Left:** Total initial tomatoes - number of picked tomatoes\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Tomatoes Left} = (105 + x) - 137 \\]\n\nWe need to find a concrete number for the remaining tomatoes, meaning the sum must be valid under reasonable conditions considering we don't know the initial red tomatoes' count explicitly. \n\nFor the calculation:\n- Assume \\( x \\), the number of red tomatoes initially, is at least 32, so that the initial total exceeds the number picked.\n\nTherefore, if: \n\\[ x = 32 \\]\nthen,\n\\[ 105 + 32 = 137 \\]\nIn this case, all tomatoes are picked.\n\nIf we require tomato leftovers:\n- Assume \\( x \\) is more than 32; take \\( x = 35 \\)\n\nThen:\n\\[ 105 + 35 = 140 \\]\n\nNow:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Tomatoes Left} = 140 - 137 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, assuming there were initially 35 red tomatoes, and hence 140 total tomatoes, there would be 3 left after picking 137 tomatoes.\n\n### Final Answer: 3 tomatoes left ###",

We know that they harvest 76 sacks of oranges per day.\n2. Each sack contains 50 oranges.\n\nTo find the total number of oranges harvested per day, we multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total oranges per day} = \\text{Number of sacks per day} \\times \\text{Oranges per sack}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total oranges per day} = 76 \\, \\text{sacks/day} \\times 50 \\, \\text{oranges/sack} = 3800 \\, \\text{oranges/day}\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of oranges harvested per day is 3800.\n\n### 3800 oranges per day ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges are harvested per day based on the information given. Here, we have the details about the number of sacks harvested and discarded.\n\nGiven:\n- 76 sacks are harvested per day.\n- 64 of these sacks are discarded.\n\nWe are asked how many oranges are harvested per day. The question implies counting oranges in the harvested sacks, and although the number of oranges per sack is not given, we need only the data about how many sacks are harvested.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sacks harvested each day is simply the amount initially collected, regardless of the number being discarded later on.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Harvested per day** = 76 sacks\n\nAssuming the intent is to find how many sacks are initially harvested before any discarding, this is straightforward since it provides the total directly.\n\nThe answer remains 76, as the question pertains to the count before any are discarded.\n\n### Final Answer:\n76 sacks are harvested per day.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Total Crackers Matthew Had**: Matthew initially had 23 crackers.\n\n2. **Crackers Left**: After giving some crackers to his 2 friends, Matthew has 11 crackers left.\n\n3. **Crackers Given Away**: We need to calculate how many crackers Matthew gave away to his friends. This can be found by subtracting the number of crackers Matthew has left from the total crackers he initially had:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Crackers Given Away} = 23 - 11 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Number of Friends**: Matthew gave crackers to 2 friends.\n\n5. **Crackers Each Friend Ate**: Since there were a total of 12 crackers given equally to 2 friends, each friend received an equal share. To find out how many crackers each friend received, divide the total crackers given by the number of friends:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Crackers Each Friend Ate} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n### Each friend ate 6 crackers.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's define some variables:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of crackers Matthew had.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of crackers each friend ate.\n\nAccording to the problem, Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends. Therefore, the total number of crackers given away is \\( 2y \\).\n\nAfter giving away the crackers, Matthew has 11 crackers left. This situation can be described by the equation:\n\n\\[\nx - 2y = 11\n\\]\n\nSince we do not have the initial number of crackers \\( x \\), we need to assume a plausible value. Let's assume Matthew initially had 31 crackers (this is a randomly chosen number for the purpose of solving the problem). Then we have:\n\n\\[\n31 - 2y = 11\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n31 - 2y = 11 \\\\\n31 - 11 = 2y \\\\\n20 = 2y \\\\\ny = 10\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each friend ate \\( 10 \\) crackers.\n\n### 10",

Then, 3 new apples grew on the tree. We add these 3 apples to the current number:\n\n   \\[\n   2 + 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\nSo, the number of apples on the tree now is 5.\n\n###  \nThe final answer is 5 apples.",

        "ambiguos question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and some cups of flour. She already put in 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?",
        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the amounts required:**\n   - Sugar required by the recipe: 12 cups\n   - Flour required by the recipe: 14 cups\n\n2. **Identify how much sugar has already been added:**\n   - Sugar already added: 10 cups\n\n3. **Calculate the additional sugar needed:**\n   - Additional sugar needed = Sugar required - Sugar already added\n   - Additional sugar needed = 12 cups - 10 cups = 2 cups of sugar\n\n4. **Determine the flour needed to complete the recipe:**\n   - Flour required by the recipe: 14 cups\n\n5. **Calculate the difference in the amount of flour and sugar still needed:**\n   - Since she needs 2 more cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour, we calculate the difference:\n   - Difference in additional amounts = Flour needed - Additional sugar needed\n   - Difference in additional amounts = 14 cups - 2 cups = 12 cups\n\nTherefore, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.\n\n### \nFinal Answer: Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.",
        "ambiguos answer": "The problem as stated seems to have incomplete information because it doesn't specify how much flour is required by the recipe. Nevertheless, I'll proceed with what we know and make some sensible assumptions to provide a concrete answer.\n\nThe problem states:\n- The recipe requires 12 cups of sugar.\n- Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar.\n  \nFirst, determine how many more cups of sugar need to be added:\n\\[ \n12 \\, \\text{cups} \\, (\\text{needed}) - 10 \\, \\text{cups} \\, (\\text{added}) = 2 \\, \\text{cups} \\, \\text{of sugar still needed.}\n\\]\n\nThe final task is to determine how many more cups of flour than sugar Mary should add. Since the problem is missing the amount of flour required, let's make an assumption for illustrative purposes.\n\nAssume the recipe requires 15 cups of flour.\n\nSo, she needs to add the 2 remaining cups of sugar and the entire amount of flour since no flour has been added yet:\n- Additional cups of sugar needed = 2\n- Additional cups of flour needed = 15\n\nNow calculate the number of additional cups of flour more than sugar:\n\\[ \n\\text{Additional cups of flour} - \\text{Additional cups of sugar} = 15 - 2 = 13\n\\]\n\nThus, Mary needs to add 13 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.\n\n### 13",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.\n\n1. **Initial Situation**: Jerry starts with 7 action figures.\n2. **Additions and Removals**:\n   - He adds some more action figures. Let's call the number of action figures he added \\( x \\).\n   - He removes 10 action figures.\n\n3. **Final Situation**: After making these changes, Jerry has 8 action figures on the shelf.\n\nUsing this information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial action figures} + \\text{Added action figures} - \\text{Removed action figures} = \\text{Final action figures}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n7 + x - 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n7 + x - 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\nx - 3 = 8\n\\]\n\nAdd 3 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 8 + 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 11\n\\]\n\nThus, Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.\n\n### Answer: Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's define a variable and set up an equation based on the information given:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of action figures Jerry had initially on his shelf.\n\n2. Jerry added some more action figures. Let's say he added \\( y \\) action figures.\n\n3. After adding the new action figures, Jerry removed 10 old action figures.\n\n4. Now, it is given that there are 8 action figures on the shelf.\n\nWe can set up the following equation to describe the situation:\n\n\\[\nx + y - 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nWe need to find out the value of \\( y \\), the number of action figures Jerry added.\n\nFirst, solve for \\( y \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + y - 10 = 8\n\\]\n\nAdd 10 to both sides of the equation to simplify:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 18\n\\]\n\nSince we don't have the actual initial number of figures, we'll assume that Jerry did have some figures at the beginning, let's say he started with \\( x = 0 \\) or he added the first figures.\n\nThen, substituting \\( x = 0 \\) (assuming no initial figures):\n\n\\[\n0 + y = 18\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( y \\), we get:\n\n\\[\ny = 18\n\\]\n\nThis means he added 18 action figures to the shelf if we assume he initially had no figures or removed 10 which can be dummily considered as 10 removed and left 0 initially for the equation satisfaction as information missing.\n\n### Therefore, the number of action figures Jerry added is 18.",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more birds there are than storks on the fence.\n\n1. Start by identifying what we know:\n   - There are initially 3 birds on the fence.\n   - Some storks are also on the fence, but their number is not specified. We can assume a random value for the number of storks. For simplicity, let's assume there are 4 storks.\n\n2. Then, according to the problem, 2 more birds join the original birds:\n   - Initial number of birds = 3\n   - Additional birds = 2\n   - Total number of birds = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n3. Now, find the number of birds more than storks:\n   - We have assumed there are 4 storks.\n\n4. Calculate the difference:\n   - Difference = Total number of birds - Number of storks\n   - Difference = 5 - 4 = 1\n\nThus, the number of more birds than storks sitting on the fence is 1.\n\n### 1",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Birds on the Fence:**\n   - We start with 2 birds.\n\n2. **Additional Birds Joining:**\n   - 3 more birds came to join them.\n\n3. **Total Number of Birds:**\n   - Initial birds: 2\n   - Additional birds: 3\n   - Total birds on the fence: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n\n4. **Number of Storks:**\n   - We have 6 storks on the fence.\n\n5. **Difference Calculation:**\n   - We need to find how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence.\n   - Total storks: 6\n   - Total birds: 5\n   - Difference: \\(6 - 5 = 1\\)\n\nThus, there are 1 more stork than birds sitting on the fence.\n\n### 1",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we first need to define the number of birds and storks initially present. The problem states that two birds were initially on the fence and then three more birds joined, leading to a total of:\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{ (initial birds)} + 3 \\text{ (additional birds)} = 5 \\text{ birds total}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the initial number of storks. We need this piece of information to answer the question about comparing the count of storks versus birds. For the sake of solving, let's assume a random number of storks. Assume there are initially, for instance, 8 storks.\n\nHence, we have:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ storks on the fence} \n\\]\n\nNow, we compare the number of storks to the number of birds on the fence:\n\n- Total number of birds = 5.\n- Total number of storks = 8.\n\nTo find out \"how many more storks than birds,\" we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ storks} - 5 \\text{ birds} = 3 \\text{ more storks}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 3 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.\n\n### The answer is 3.",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more action figures than books Jerry has on the shelf after adding the additional books.\n\n1. **Initial Count of Items:**\n   - Action figures: 7\n   - Books: 2\n\n2. **Add Additional Books:**\n   - Jerry adds 4 more books.\n\n   So the total number of books now is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 4 = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Number of action figures: 7\n   - Total number of books: 6\n\n   To find how many more action figures than books, subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:\n   \\[\n   7 - 6 = 1\n   \\]\n\n**###\n\nTherefore, there is 1 more action figure than books on the shelf.**",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the given problem, we need to determine the number of action figures and books that Jerry has on his shelf and then find the difference.\n\n1. **Identify Given Information:**\n\n   - Jerry has 7 action figures initially.\n   - Jerry has some books on the shelf initially.\n   - Jerry added more books to the shelf later.\n\n2. **Unknowns:**\n\n   - Let's denote the initial number of books as \\( x \\).\n   - Let's denote the number of books added as \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Total Number of Books:**\n\n   - The total number of books on the shelf after adding is \\( x + y \\).\n\n4. **Determine the Difference in Number:**\n\n   - We want to know how many more action figures Jerry has compared to books. Hence, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Number of action figures} - \\text{Total number of books}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 7 - (x + y)\n     \\]\n\nSince the problem does not specify the initial number of books (\\( x \\)) or the number of books added (\\( y \\)), we need to make assumptions:\n\n5. **Assume Necessary Condition:**\n\n   - Assume Jerry initially had 4 books and later added 3 more books. Thus, \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Numerical Answer:**\n\n   - Total number of books: \\( x + y = 4 + 3 = 7 \\)\n   - Difference: \\( 7 - 7 = 0 \\)\n\n### \n\nThis calculation shows that Jerry has 0 more action figures than books on his shelf. The assumptions made were necessary to provide a complete numerical answer to the problem.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many water bottles Debby drank over the 11 days and then subtract that from the total number of water bottles she initially bought. Here are the calculation steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of water bottles Debby drank in 11 days.\n   - She drank 15 bottles each day for 11 days.\n   - Total bottles drank = 15 bottles/day \u00d7 11 days = 165 bottles\n\n2. Subtract the number of bottles she drank from the initial number of bottles.\n   - Initially, she had 264 bottles.\n   - Bottles left = Initial bottles - Bottles drank\n   - Bottles left = 264 - 165 = 99\n\nTherefore, Debby has 99 bottles left.\n\n###  \n99",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of bottles Debby drank:**\n   Debby drinks 15 bottles a day for 11 days. To find out the total number of bottles she drank, multiply the number of bottles per day by the number of days:\n\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ bottles/day} \\times 11 \\text{ days} = 165 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find out how many bottles Debby originally had:**\n   The problem does not specify how many water bottles Debby originally bought. Without this information, we cannot calculate how many bottles she has left.\n\n   To proceed, let's assume a random value for the number of bottles Debby originally bought. Suppose she bought 200 bottles.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of bottles remaining:**\n   If Debby started with 200 bottles and drank 165 bottles over 11 days, the number of bottles she has left is:\n\n   \\[\n   200 \\text{ bottles (originally)} - 165 \\text{ bottles (drank)} = 35 \\text{ bottles}\n   \\]\n\nThus, assuming Debby originally purchased 200 bottles, she would have 35 bottles left after drinking for 11 days.\n\n### 35 bottles ###",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of campers who went either rowing or hiking over the course of the day.\n\nFirst, let's list the information given:\n1. 41 campers went rowing in the morning.\n2. 4 campers went hiking in the morning.\n3. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon.\n\nThe problem aims to find the total number of unique campers who participated in either activity during the day. However, the problem doesn't state if there are any campers participating in both rowing and hiking or if any campers went rowing both in the morning and in the afternoon. In the absence of any further information, we must make assumptions to solve it.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. There is no overlap between the campers who went rowing in the morning and afternoon\u2014that is, the campers who went rowing in the afternoon didn't row in the morning.\n2. None of the campers who went hiking also went rowing.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n1. **Total Campers for Canoeing or Rowing:**\n   - 41 campers went rowing in the morning.\n   - Assuming no overlap with the morning group, 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of unique campers who went rowing is \\(41 + 26 = 67\\).\n\n2. **Adding Campers Who Went Hiking:**\n   - There were 4 campers who went hiking.\n\n3. **Total Unique Campers for Both Activities:**\n   Hence, adding in the hikers:\n\n   \\[\n   67 \\text{ (rowers) } + 4 \\text{ (hikers) } = 71 \\text{ (unique campers) }\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on these assumptions, the total number of unique campers who participated in either rowing or hiking activities during the day is 71.\n\n### Final Answer: \n71 campers went rowing and hiking in all.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine how many campers went rowing and hiking in all, we need to understand the total number of unique campers who participated in either activity. Let's analyze and assume some necessary conditions:\n\n1. In the morning, 41 campers went rowing, and 4 campers went hiking.\n2. In the afternoon, some campers went rowing again, but we don't have a specific number for the afternoon rowing group. We assume this number since it is missing.\n\nAssume in the afternoon, 10 campers went rowing. \n\nTo solve this, we assume no campers went hiking in the afternoon as there's no mention of additional hikers.\n\nWe'll also assume there is no overlap between campers throughout the day \u2014 meaning that those who went rowing in the afternoon did not go rowing in the morning or hiking in the morning. This is a typical assumption without additional data.\n\nSo the unique campers that went rowing and hiking are:\n- 41 campers (morning rowing) \n- 4 campers (morning hiking)\n- 10 campers (afternoon rowing including those who didn't row or hike in the morning)\n\nThus, add these amounts to get the total number of unique campers taking part in either activity:\n\nTotal unique campers = morning rowing + morning hiking + new afternoon rowers that weren't accounted for earlier  \nTotal unique campers = 41 (rowers) + 4 (hikers) + 10 (afternoon independent rowers)\nTotal unique campers = 41 + 4 + 10 = 55 \n\n### \nFinal answer: 55 total unique campers went rowing or hiking in all.",

        "clear answer": "Let's analyze the problem and calculate the weight she had before starting to jog, based on the information given.\n\n1. **Current Weight:** Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms.\n\n2. **Weight Loss in the First Week:** Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week.\n\n3. **Weight Loss in the Second Week:** Jessie lost 140 kilograms in the second week.\n\nWe need to find out Jessie's weight before she started jogging. To do this, we can add the weight she lost back to her current weight.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n- First, add the weight loss in the first week and the second week together:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total weight loss} = 62 \\, \\text{kg (first week)} + 140 \\, \\text{kg (second week)} = 202 \\, \\text{kg}\n  \\]\n\n- Then, add this total weight loss to her current weight to find her original weight:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Original weight} = 9 \\, \\text{kg (current weight)} + 202 \\, \\text{kg (total weight loss)} = 211 \\, \\text{kg}\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nJessie's weight before she started jogging was 211 kilograms.\n\nSo the answer is \\### 211 kilograms.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step by establishing variables and equations based on the problem statement:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the weight Jessie was before starting to jog (this is what we need to find).\n\n2. **Information Given:**\n   - Jessie lost an unspecified amount of weight in the first week.\n   - Jessie lost 140 kilograms in the second week.\n   - By the end of both weeks, Jessie's weight is 9 kilograms.\n\n3. **Formulate an Equation:**\n   Assume Jessie lost \\( x \\) kilograms in the first week.\n\n4. Considering the total weight change, we can write:\n   \\[\n   w - x - 140 = 9\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( w \\) is her initial weight, \\( x \\) is the weight lost in the first week, and 140 is the weight lost in the second week, with her final weight being 9 kilograms.\n\n5. **Solve for \\( w \\):**\n   However, we need to solve for \\( w \\), but we have one equation and two unknowns (\\( w \\) and \\( x \\)).\n\n6. **Assume \\( x = 0 \\):**\n   To solve, we need to assume a value for \\( x \\). Assumption: Jessie lost 0 kilograms in the first week.\n\n7. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   w - 0 - 140 = 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w - 140 = 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = 9 + 140\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = 149\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, assuming she lost no weight in the first week, Jessie's weight before starting to jog was ### 149 kilograms.",

        "clear answer": "To find out how many cakes the baker still has, we need to calculate the total number of cakes he made and then subtract the number of cakes he sold.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cakes baked:\n   - Baker initially made 62 cakes.\n   - Then he made 149 more cakes.\n   - Total cakes baked = Initial cakes + Additional cakes = 62 + 149 = 211 cakes.\n\n2. Subtract the number of cakes sold:\n   - The baker sold 144 cakes.\n   - Cakes remaining = Total cakes baked - Cakes sold = 211 - 144 = 67 cakes.\n\nTherefore, the baker would still have 67 cakes.\n\n### 67",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Cakes**: The baker initially made 62 cakes.\n2. **Additional Cakes Made**: The baker then made 149 more cakes.\n3. **Total Cakes Made**: To find the total number of cakes made by the baker, we add the initial number of cakes to the additional cakes made.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cakes} = 62 + 149 = 211\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cakes Sold**: The problem does not specify how many cakes were sold. To proceed, let's assume that the baker sold \\( x \\) cakes.\n\n5. **Cakes Remaining**: To calculate how many cakes the baker still has, subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes. Therefore, the number of cakes left with the baker would be:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remaining cakes} = 211 - x\n   \\]\n\nSince the specific number of cakes sold (\\( x \\)) is not provided in the problem, we cannot determine a numerical final answer without this information. \n\n### \nTherefore, without knowing \\( x \\), the exact number of cakes remaining cannot be accurately determined. If you provide the number of cakes sold, we can recalculate the remaining cakes.",

        "ambiguos question": "In Haley's class, 4 boys love to play marbles. If Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself, how many marbles will each of the boys receive?",
        "clear answer": "To find out how many marbles each boy will receive, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine how many marbles are distributed**: \n   - Haley has 23 marbles total.\n   - She wants to keep 15 marbles for herself.\n\n   So, the number of marbles to be distributed is:\n\n   \\( 23 - 15 = 8 \\) marbles.\n\n2. **Determine how many boys are sharing the marbles**:\n   - According to the problem, there are 4 boys.\n\n3. **Divide the marbles equally among the boys**:\n   - We distribute the 8 marbles equally among the 4 boys.\n\n   \\( \\frac{8 \\text{ marbles}}{4 \\text{ boys}} = 2 \\text{ marbles per boy} \\).\n\n### \nEach of the boys will receive 2 marbles.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to know the total number of marbles available. Since that information is missing, let's assume a random total number of marbles. For simplicity, let's assume there are 50 marbles in total.\n\nGiven that Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself, we can calculate the number of marbles remaining for the boys:\n\n\\[ \\text{Marbles remaining for the boys} = \\text{Total Marbles} - \\text{Marbles kept by Haley} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Marbles remaining for the boys} = 50 - 15 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Marbles remaining for the boys} = 35 \\]\n\nNow, we divide the remaining marbles equally among the 4 boys:\n\n\\[ \\text{Marbles per boy} = \\frac{\\text{Marbles remaining for the boys}}{\\text{Number of boys}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Marbles per boy} = \\frac{35}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Marbles per boy} = 8.75 \\]\n\nSince marbles cannot be divided into fractions, it's likely each boy will receive 8 marbles, and there will be 3 marbles left unallocated. However, if the assumption here is that marbles can be distributed equally precisely, then each will receive 8.75 marbles. \n\nFor practical purposes, each boy would receive 8 marbles, and 3 marbles would remain as leftover.\n\n### Answer: Each boy would receive 8 marbles (with 3 marbles remaining).",

There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and some new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?",
        "clear answer": "To determine the number of bird families left near the mountain, we can break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Bird Families:** Start with the 49 bird families living near the mountain.\n\n2. **Bird Families that Migrated:** Subtract the 59 bird families that flew away for the winter.\n\n   \\[\n   49 - 59 = -10\n   \\]\n\n   At this step, we have a negative number, which suggests at this point, more families have left than originally were present, leading to a deficit of 10 bird families. Negative bird families do not make sense practically, but for calculation, it holds.\n\n3. **New Bird Families Arriving:** Add the 24 new bird families that came to live from the Arctic.\n\n   \\[\n   -10 + 24 = 14\n   \\]\n\n### \nThus, there are 14 bird families left near the mountain after accounting for those that migrated and the new arrivals.",

Assume that 70 new bird families come to live near the mountain.\n\nLet's calculate the remaining number of bird families:\n\n- Calculate the initial loss by subtracting the bird families that left:\n  \\[\n  49 - 59 = -10\n  \\]\n  This indicates that 10 more families left than were presently there (meaning temporary deficit).\n\n- Now, add the new families arriving:\n  \\[\n  -10 + 70 = 60\n  \\]\n\nThus, the number of bird families left near the mountain is 60.\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is ### 60 ###.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many blocks Randy has left after using some of them to build a tower and a house.\n\nHere are the steps to arrive at the answer:\n\n1. **Start with Total Number of Blocks:**\n   - Randy initially has 79 blocks.\n\n2. **Blocks Used for the Tower:**\n   - Randy uses 14 blocks to build a tower.\n\n3. **Blocks Used for the House:**\n   - Randy uses 11 blocks to build a house.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Blocks Used:**\n   - Total blocks used = Blocks for tower + Blocks for house\n   - Total blocks used = 14 + 11 = 25 blocks\n\n5. **Calculate Blocks Remaining:**\n   - Blocks remaining = Total blocks initially - Total blocks used\n   - Blocks remaining = 79 - 25\n\n6. **Perform the Subtraction:**\n   - 79 - 25 = 54\n\nTherefore, Randy has 54 blocks left.\n\n### 54",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find out how many blocks are left after Randy uses some to build a tower and some to build a house, we need to determine how many blocks were used for the house. However, the problem does not specify the number of blocks used for the house, so we have to assume a random value for this.\n\nLet's assume Randy uses 20 blocks to build the house. Now we can calculate as follows:\n\n1. Total blocks Randy has initially: 79 blocks\n2. Blocks used to build the tower: 14 blocks\n3. Blocks used to build the house: 20 blocks (assumed value)\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of blocks left:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Blocks used for tower and house} = 14 + 20 = 34\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Blocks left} = 79 - 34 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, assuming Randy uses 20 blocks for the house, he would have 45 blocks left.\n\n### 45 blocks",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Determine the number of tables and chairs:**\n   - They have 5 sets of tables.\n   - Each set has 10 chairs.\n\n   From the problem, it's not explicitly mentioned how many tables each set contains. For the purpose of solving this problem, let's assume that each set contains 1 table. \n\n2. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**\n\n   Since each set contains 10 chairs and there are 5 sets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of chairs} = 5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of tables:**\n\n   Assuming each set consists of 1 table, then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of tables} = 5 \\times 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate how many more chairs than tables are there:**\n\n   Subtract the number of tables from the number of chairs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{More chairs than tables} = 50 - 5 = 45\n   \\]\n\nThus, they have 45 more chairs than tables.\n\n### Final Answer: 45 chairs more than tables.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we first need to understand the information given:\n\n- Each set consists of 1 table and 10 chairs.\n- We need to find out how many more chairs than tables there are.\n\nGiven the question doesn't specify how many sets they have, let's assume they have \\( n \\) sets. Therefore:\n\n1. Number of tables they have = \\( n \\) (1 table per set).\n2. Number of chairs they have = \\( 10n \\) (10 chairs per set).\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the number of chairs and the number of tables:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of chairs} - \\text{Number of tables} = 10n - n = 9n\n\\]\n\nWe must assume a value for \\( n \\) to provide a concrete numerical answer. Let's assume there are \\( n = 5 \\) sets. \n\n- Number of tables = \\( 5 \\)\n- Number of chairs = \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\)\n\nThe difference between the number of chairs and tables is:\n\n\\[\n50 - 5 = 45\n\\]\n\nThus, they have 45 more chairs than tables.\n\n### 45 ###",

        "ambiguos question": "Paul got a box of 440 crayons for his birthday. During the school year, he gave some crayons to his friends while he lost 106 crayons. How many crayons did he have left?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of crayons Paul has left after giving some to his friends and losing others. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Crayons Initially:**\n   - Paul initially has 440 crayons.\n\n2. **Calculate the Crayons Given to Friends:**\n   - Paul gave away 111 crayons to his friends.\n\n3. **Calculate the Crayons He Lost:**\n   - Paul lost 106 crayons.\n\n4. **Find the Remaining Crayons:**\n   - First, calculate the total number of crayons Paul no longer has due to giving and losing them:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total given and lost} = 111 + 106 = 217\n     \\]\n\n   - Subtract the total number of crayons given away and lost from the initial total:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining crayons} = 440 - 217 = 223\n     \\]\n\nSo, Paul has 223 crayons left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n### 223 crayons ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find out how many crayons Paul has left, we need to subtract the number of crayons he gave away and lost from the total number of crayons he originally had.\n\n1. Start with the total number of crayons Paul received:  \n   \\( \\text{Total crayons} = 440 \\)\n\n2. Subtract the number of crayons Paul lost:  \n   \\( \\text{Crayons after loss} = 440 - 106 \\)\n\n   Calculate this:  \n   \\( 440 - 106 = 334 \\)\n\n3. Since the problem doesn't specify how many crayons Paul gave to his friends, let's assume another random number of crayons given, say he gave 50 crayons to his friends for the sake of completing the problem (since if this were a real test question, it might specify such a number).\n\n4. Further subtract the crayons given away:  \n   \\( \\text{Crayons after giving away} = 334 - 50 \\)\n\n   Calculate this:  \n   \\( 334 - 50 = 284 \\)\n\n### \nPaul has 284 crayons left.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, let's first clarify the given information and proceed with the calculations step-by-step.\n\n1. **Information Given:**\n   - The total weight of strawberries picked by Marco and his dad together is 4 pounds.\n   - Marco's strawberries alone weighed 19 pounds.\n\n2. **Address the Logical Inconsistency:**\n   - There's an inconsistency here. Marco cannot have 19 pounds of strawberries if he and his dad together only have 4 pounds. \n   - We need to assume a reasonable value to proceed.\n\n3. **Assumption:**\n   - Let's assume there was a typo, and the total weight meant to be higher than Marco's weight could be the typo.\n   - Let's assume for calculation that Marco also picked 3 pounds, and dad has 1 pound for them to total 4 correctly. Then Marco's dad strawberries would be 1 pound.\n\n5. **Determine the Difference:**\n   - If Marco's strawberries are assumed 3 pounds (as per logical assumption), and his dad's strawberries are 1 pound, then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 3 - 1 = 2 \\text{ pounds}\n     \\]\n\n###  \nBased on a logical assumption that aligns with the total, Marco's strawberries weighed 2 pounds more than his dad's.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's define variables to represent the weights of the strawberries picked by Marco and his dad:\n\n- Let \\( m \\) be the weight of the strawberries that Marco picked (in pounds).\n- Let \\( d \\) be the weight of the strawberries that Marco's dad picked (in pounds).\n\nWe are given that together, their strawberries weighed 4 pounds:\n\n\\[\nm + d = 4\n\\]\n\nWe need to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weigh than his dad's. This is asking for the value of \\( m - d \\).\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide any additional specific information regarding the actual values of \\( m \\) and \\( d \\), let's assume a reasonable distribution of weights:\n\nAssume Marco's strawberries weigh more than his dad's, specifically:\n\n- Suppose \\( m = 3 \\) pounds\n- Then \\( d = 4 - m = 4 - 3 = 1 \\) pound\n\nNow, calculate the difference in weight:\n\n\\[\nm - d = 3 - 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, assuming Marco picked 3 pounds and his dad picked 1 pound, Marco's strawberries weigh 2 pounds more than his dad's.\n\n### 2",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries and then compare it with the weight of Marco's strawberries.\n\nWe have the following information:\n\n1. Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds.\n2. Together, Marco and his dad's strawberries weighed 47 pounds.\n\nLet's denote the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries as \\( x \\).\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1. The total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries is the sum of the weight of Marco's strawberries and the weight of his dad's strawberries:\n   \n   \\[\n   30 + x = 47\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve for \\( x \\) to find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 47 - 30 = 17\n   \\]\n\nSo, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 17 pounds.\n\n3. Now, find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed compared to his dad's:\n\n   \\[\n   30 - 17 = 13\n   \\]\n\nThus, Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his dad's strawberries.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nMarco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his dad's strawberries. \n\nRemark: ### 13 pounds.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more Marco's strawberries weighed compared to his dad's, based on the total weight provided.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( m \\) as the weight of Marco's strawberries in pounds.\n- \\( d \\) as the weight of his dad's strawberries in pounds.\n\nWe are given the following equation based on the total weight:\n\\[ m + d = 47 \\]\n\nHowever, without additional information about either Marco's or his dad's specific weights, we can't solve this problem directly.\n\nTo proceed, let's assume a plausible random value for \\( m \\). \n\nAssume Marco's strawberries weigh 27 pounds (a random assumption to work with):\n- \\( m = 27 \\)\n\nUsing the total weight equation:\n\\[ 27 + d = 47 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( d \\):\n\\[ d = 47 - 27 \\]\n\\[ d = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we want to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weigh than his dad's:\n\\[ m - d = 27 - 20 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marco's strawberries weigh 7 pounds more than his dad's strawberries.\n\nThus, the answer is: ### 7 pounds ###",

        "ambiguos answer": "To find out how much money Dan has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from the money he initially had.\n\n1. **Initial Amount:** Dan initially has $7.\n\n2. **Amount Spent on Candy Bar:** Dan bought a candy bar for $2.\n\n3. **Amount Spent on Chocolate:** The problem doesn't specify the cost of the chocolate. For the purpose of solving this problem, we need to assume a value. Let's assume the chocolate costs $3.\n\n4. **Total Amount Spent:** \n   - Cost of candy bar: $2\n   - Cost of chocolate: $3\n   - Total spent: $2 + $3 = $5\n\n5. **Calculate Remaining Money:**\n   - Initial amount: $7\n   - Total amount spent: $5\n   - Money left: $7 - $5 = $2\n\nSo, Dan has $2 left.\n\n### $2",

        "ambiguos question": "Matthew had 15 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his friends and still had 10 crackers left, how many crackers did each friend eat?",
        "clear answer": "Let's work through the problem together.\n\n1. Determine how many crackers Matthew gave away. Since he ended up with 10 crackers, the number of crackers given away is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Crackers Given Away} = \\text{Initial Crackers} - \\text{Remaining Crackers} = 15 - 10 = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. Matthew gave crackers to 5 friends. To find out how many crackers each friend received, divide the total number given away by the number of friends:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Crackers per Friend} = \\frac{\\text{Crackers Given Away}}{\\text{Number of Friends}} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n\nThus, each friend received 1 cracker.\n\n### Final Answer: Each friend ate 1 cracker. ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crackers Matthew gave away to his friends and then calculate how many each friend received.\n\nGiven:\n- Matthew initially had 15 crackers.\n- After giving crackers to his friends, he was left with 10 crackers.\n\nThe number of crackers given away is:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ crackers} - 10 \\text{ crackers} = 5 \\text{ crackers} \\]\n\nMatthew gave 5 crackers to his friends. However, the problem does not specify how many friends he has. Since this information is missing, let's assume Matthew has 5 friends for simplicity.\n\nAssuming Matthew has 5 friends, the number of crackers each friend received is:\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\text{ crackers}}{5 \\text{ friends}} = 1 \\text{ cracker per friend} \\]\n\nTherefore, each friend ate 1 cracker.\n\n### 1 cracker ###\n\nIf you would like a different assumption (such as a different number of friends), please let me know, and I can adjust the calculation accordingly.",

Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\nThe recipe calls for:\n- 9 cups of sugar\n- 7 cups of flour\n- 4 cups of salt\n\nMary has already added some flour, but the problem does not specify how much, which is a bit ambiguous. However, since we are asked to find how many more cups of flour than salt she needs to add from the total amount required, we can make the comparison based on the required amounts for each ingredient.\n\nThe recipe requires:\n- Flour: 7 cups\n- Salt: 4 cups\n\nTo find out how many more cups of flour than salt she needs to add, calculate the difference between the total amount of flour and the total amount of salt required by the recipe.\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 7 \\text{ cups of flour} - 4 \\text{ cups of salt} = 3 \\text{ cups} \\]\n\nTherefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt.\n\n### \nThe answer is 3 cups.",

        "ambiguos answer": "To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we need to determine how many books he had initially and how many were sold. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Information:**\n   - Paul had some initial number of books which we don't know yet. Let's call this initial number \\( x \\).\n   - He gave 35 books to his friend.\n   - After giving away the books, he had 62 books left.\n\n2. **Expression for Books Left:**\n   - After giving the books away, Paul was left with 62 books. Therefore, the equation can be set up as:\n     \\[\n     x - (\\text{books sold}) - 35 = 62\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find Books Sold (Rearrange the Equation):**\n   - Rearranging the equation above to solve for the books sold gives:\n     \\[\n     \\text{books sold} = x - 35 - 62\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Total Initial Books:**\n   - From the equation, we can rewrite:\n     \\[ \n     x - 35 = 62 \n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 62 + 35 = 97\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find How Many Books Were Sold:**\n   - Now we know the initial number of books \\( x \\) was 97.\n   - Using the expression for books sold, plug in \\( x = 97 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{books sold} = 97 - 35 - 62\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{books sold} = 97 - 97 = 0\n     \\]\n\n### \nTherefore, Paul initially sold 0 books in the garage sale, and after giving away 35 books, he was left with the remaining 62 books. The key here is understanding that all remaining books were not sold but simply given away.",

        "ambiguos question": "Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and some unripe apples. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?",
        "clear answer": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Current Status of the Tree:**\n   - The tree now has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples.\n\n2. **Total Apples Currently on the Tree:**\n   - Total apples currently on the tree = 2 ripe apples + 4 unripe apples = 6 apples.\n\n3. **Apples Picked by Rachel:**\n   - Rachel initially picked 6 ripe apples from the tree.\n\n4. **Apples Originally on the Tree:**\n   - The current total number of apples on the tree is 6.\n   - Since Rachel picked 6 ripe apples, we can find the original total number of apples on the tree by adding these picked apples to the current total apples.\n\n5. **Calculation:**\n   - Original total number of apples on the tree = Current apples on the tree (6) + Apples picked by Rachel (6)\n   - Original total number of apples on the tree = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n### \nThe tree originally had 12 apples.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine the total number of apples the tree had initially, we need to consider both the ripe and unripe apples.\n\nWe know:\n1. Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree.\n2. After picking, the tree has 2 ripe apples remaining.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ripe apples initially on the tree.\n- Since Rachel picked 6 ripe apples and 2 ripe apples remain, the total number of ripe apples initially is:\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ (picked apples)} + 2 \\text{ (remaining ripe apples)} = 8 \\text{ ripe apples}\n  \\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the total initial number of apples on the tree.\n- Given that there are \"some unripe apples,\" we do not have an explicit number of unripe apples. Since the question only asks for the total number of apples to begin with, and only gives specific information about ripe apples, we make a general assumption that the tree originally only had ripe apples.\n- Therefore, based solely on the given information, the tree initially had 8 apples.\n\nConcluding, if we're solely determining the number of apples (given the missing explicit mention of unripe apples, and assuming only stated conditions), the initial number of apples on the tree was:\n- Initial total ripened apples: \\(8\\).\n- No information provided for unripe apples (assumed 0 for calculation).\n\nThus, the total number of apples the tree initially had is:\n\n### 8 apples ###\n",

        "clear answer": "To solve how many apps Dave deleted from his phone, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Apps**: Dave originally had 10 apps on his phone.\n\n2. **Apps Added**: Dave added 11 new apps to his phone.\n\n   - Total apps after adding new ones: \\( 10 + 11 = 21 \\) apps\n\n3. **Apps Remaining**: After deleting some apps, Dave had 4 apps left on his phone.\n\n4. **Apps Deleted**: To find out how many apps were deleted, we subtract the number of apps remaining from the total number of apps after adding new ones.\n\n   - Number of apps deleted = Total apps before deletion - Apps remaining\n   - \\( 21 - 4 = 17 \\)\n\nTherefore, Dave deleted 17 apps.\n\n### Answer: 17 apps",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we'll define some variables and set up an equation based on the information provided.\n\nLet's say Dave initially had \\( x \\) apps on his phone.\n\n1. **Initial Situation**: Dave has \\( x \\) apps.\n2. **Adding Apps**: Dave adds 11 new apps. So, the total number of apps now = \\( x + 11 \\).\n3. **After Deletion**: After deleting some apps, Dave has 4 apps left. So the number of apps after deletion is 4.\n\nWe can set up the following equation based on the operations:\n\n\\[ x + 11 - \\text{deleted apps} = 4 \\]\n\nLet \\( d \\) be the number of apps deleted. Then:\n\n\\[ x + 11 - d = 4 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( d \\).\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d = x + 11 - 4 \\]\n\\[ d = x + 7 \\]\n\nTo find a concrete numerical answer, assume a random initial value for \\( x \\). For simplicity, let's assume Dave initially had 5 apps.\n\n\\[ d = 5 + 7 = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of apps Dave deleted is 12.\n\n### 12",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to compare the total number of cakes that the baker made to the number of cakes he sold. Here's how to do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of cakes made:**\n   - Initially, the baker made 81 cakes.\n   - Then, he made 92 more cakes.\n   - Total cakes made = 81 + 92 = 173 cakes.\n\n2. **Determine the number of cakes sold:**\n   - The baker sold 46 cakes.\n\n3. **Calculate how many more cakes were made than sold:**\n   - Difference in cakes made and cakes sold = Total cakes made - Cakes sold\n   - Difference = 173 - 46 = 127 cakes.\n\nTherefore, the baker made 127 more cakes than he sold.\n\n### 127",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find out how many cakes the baker made in total and how many more cakes he made than those he sold.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Cakes:**\n   - Unfortunately, the problem doesn't specify how many cakes the baker originally made. We can assume a random number to proceed. Let's assume the baker originally made \\( x \\) cakes.\n\n2. **Cakes Made Later:**\n   - The baker made 92 more cakes.\n\n3. **Total Cakes Made:**\n   - The total number of cakes made is \\( x + 92 \\).\n\n4. **Cakes Sold:**\n   - The baker sold 46 cakes.\n\n5. **Difference Between Made and Sold:**\n   - To find out how many more cakes the baker made than those he sold, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made:\n   \\[\n   (x + 92) - 46\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   \\[\n   x + 92 - 46 = x + 46\n   \\]\n\nThe expression \\( x + 46 \\) represents how many more cakes the baker made than he sold. If the initial number of cakes \\( x \\) is known, we can plug it in to get a specific number. Since \\( x \\) was not given, we assumed an arbitrary value.\n\nIf we want a concrete numerical answer, let's assume that the baker originally made 0 cakes, meaning:\n\\[\nx = 0\n\\]\nThen the calculation becomes:\n\\[\n(0 + 92) - 46 = 92 - 46 = 46\n\\]\n\n### The baker made 46 more cakes than he sold.",

We know:\n\n- He has 15 aquariums for saltwater animals.\n- Each aquarium has 19 animals.\n- He also has some aquariums for freshwater animals, but we're not given the exact number.\n\nLet's assume a random number of 10 aquariums for freshwater animals to proceed with the calculation.\n\n1. Calculate the number of animals in saltwater aquariums:\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ aquariums} \\times 19 \\text{ animals per aquarium} = 285 \\text{ animals}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of animals in freshwater aquariums (based on our assumption):\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ aquariums} \\times 19 \\text{ animals per aquarium} = 190 \\text{ animals}\n   \\]\n\n3.

        "ambiguos question": "Jerry had some action figures and 9 books on a shelf in his room. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. How many more action figures than books were on his shelf?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many action figures are on Jerry's shelf and then compare that to the number of books to determine how many more action figures there are than books.\n\n1. **Initial Count of Action Figures:**\n   - Jerry initially had 5 action figures.\n\n2. **Action Figures Added:**\n   - Jerry added 7 more action figures.\n\n3. **Total Number of Action Figures:**\n   - Total action figures = Initial action figures + Added action figures\n   - Total action figures = 5 + 7 = 12\n\n4. **Number of Books:**\n   - Jerry has 9 books on the shelf.\n\n5. **Difference Between Action Figures and Books:**\n   - Difference = Total action figures - Number of books\n   - Difference = 12 - 9 = 3\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 3 more action figures than books on his shelf. \n\nThe final answer is:\n### 3 ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Condition:**\n   - Jerry initially has some unknown number of action figures (let's call this number \\( x \\)) and 9 books.\n\n2. **Account for the Change:**\n   - Jerry adds 7 more action figures to the shelf. Therefore, the total number of action figures becomes \\( x + 7 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Difference:**\n   - We need to find how many more action figures than books Jerry has on the shelf.\n   - The difference between the number of action figures and books is given by:\n     \\[\n     (x + 7) - 9\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   - Simplify the expression to find the difference:\n     \\[\n     (x + 7) - 9 = x + 7 - 9 = x - 2\n     \\]\n\n5. **Assume a Value to Proceed:**\n   - Since the problem states an unknown \\( x \\), we will assume a random value for \\( x \\).

If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that, how many visited Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days?",
        "clear answer": "To calculate how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days, we would typically add up the number of visitors for each of those 89 days. However, the problem only provides information for three specific days: 512 visitors today, 471 visitors yesterday, and 808 visitors the day before yesterday.\n\nBecause the problem doesn't provide information for the other 86 days, I'll assume the average daily attendance for those 86 days (besides the three given) is equal to the average of the three provided days. Let\u2019s calculate the average daily attendance for the provided three days:\n\n1. Add up the visitors for the three days:\n   \\[\n   512 + 471 + 808 = 1791\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide by the number of days (3 days) to get the average:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1791}{3} = 597\n   \\]\n\nWe will assume the average number of visitors for the other 86 days is 597 per day.\n\nNow, calculate the number of visitors for these 86 days:\n\\[\n597 \\times 86 = 51342\n\\]\n\nFinally, add the visitors from the specific three days to this total:\n\\[\n1791 + 51342 = 53133\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days is \\( \\boxed{53133} \\).",
        "ambiguos answer": "To calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days, we need to make some assumptions based on the given information. Since the problem does not provide specific daily numbers for each of the 89 days, we need to make an additional assumption or perform a calculation that will allow us to conclude.\n\nGiven:\n- 471 visitors the previous day.\n- 808 visitors the day before that.\n\nAssumption:\n- Assume these visitor numbers are an average for each of the days. Since specific daily data is not provided for all 89 days, we can assume an average or consistent number of visits per day based on either or an average of these two days.\n\nLet's calculate the result under the assumption that the average number of visitors per day is the same as the average of these two given days:\n\n1. Calculate the average number of visitors per day based on the given two days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average visitors per day} = \\frac{471 + 808}{2} = \\frac{1279}{2} = 639.5\n   \\]\n   \n2. Calculate the total number of visitors over 89 days:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total visitors in 89 days} = 639.5 \\times 89 = 56,915.5\n   \\]\n\nSince the number of visitors cannot be a fraction, we typically would round it to the nearest whole number. Hence, we approximate:\n\n3. Round the number to the nearest whole number:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total visitors in 89 days} \\approx 56,916\n   \\]\n\nThus, the estimated total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within the past 89 days is approximately:\n\n### 56,916 ###",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more pieces of candy Bobby ate compared to chocolate.\n\n1. First, calculate the total number of pieces of candy Bobby ate:\n   - Initially, Bobby ate 38 pieces of candy.\n   - Then, Bobby ate 36 more pieces of candy.\n\n   Total pieces of candy:\n   \\[\n   38 + 36 = 74\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we know that Bobby ate 16 pieces of chocolate.\n\n3. Now, find how many more pieces of candy Bobby ate than chocolate by subtracting the number of pieces of chocolate from the number of pieces of candy:\n   \\[\n   74 - 16 = 58\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate.\n\n### Answer: 58 pieces",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more pieces of candy Bobby ate than pieces of chocolate.\n\n1. We know Bobby ate some pieces of candy initially (let\u2019s call this number \\( x \\)).\n2. He then ate 36 more pieces of candy.\n3. Altogether, the total pieces of candy he ate is \\( x + 36 \\).\n\nBobby also ate 16 pieces of chocolate.\n\nWe are asked how many more pieces of candy Bobby ate compared to chocolate:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Difference in pieces} = \\text{(Total pieces of candy)} - \\text{(Pieces of chocolate)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = (x + 36) - 16 \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = x + 36 - 16 \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = x + 20 \n\\]\n\nSince the initial number of candies eaten ( \\( x \\) ) is not specified in the problem, we cannot determine a concrete numerical answer without assuming a value for \\( x \\).\n\nLet's assume Bobby initially ate 0 pieces of candy (\\( x = 0 \\)) for simplicity:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 0 + 20 = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Bobby ate 20 more pieces of candy than pieces of chocolate.\n\n### 20",

There is a discount of 106 dollars per pack. Therefore, the effective price per pack is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Effective Price} = 107 - 106 = 1 \\text{ dollar per pack}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine How Many Packs Can Be Bought with 93 Dollars:**\n   With 93 dollars, and each pack costing 1 dollar due to the discount, the number of packs you can buy is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Packs} = \\frac{93}{1} = 93 \\text{ packs}\n   \\]\n\n### Answer:\nYou can buy 93 packs of DVDs with 93 dollars.",

Start with the initial number of students:\n   - Girls: 706\n   - Boys: 222\n\n2. Add the additional number of girls who joined the school:\n   - More girls joining: 418\n\n3. Calculate the new total number of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New total girls} = 706 + 418 = 1124\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the new total number of pupils in the school by adding the boys and the new total of girls:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pupils} = 1124 \\, (\\text{girls}) + 222 \\, (\\text{boys}) = 1346\n   \\]\n\n### The total number of pupils in the school now is 1346. ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine the total number of pupils in the school now, we need to find the sum of the existing number of boys, the initial number of girls, and the additional girls who joined.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\n1. There are 222 boys in the school.\n2. 418 more girls joined the school.\n\nHowever, the initial number of girls is not mentioned, which is necessary to find the total number of pupils. To proceed, let's assume the original number of girls was \\( G \\).\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1. Assume the original number of girls in the school is \\( G \\).\n2. Calculate the new number of girls in the school: \\( G + 418 \\).\n3. Find the total number of pupils now: \\( 222\\) (boys) \\( + G + 418\\) (girls).\n\nSince we don't have a specific value for \\( G \\), let's assume \\( G = 200 \\) (choosing it randomly for the sake of calculation). \n\nUsing \\( G = 200 \\):\n\n1. The number of girls after more joined = \\( 200 + 418 = 618\\).\n2. Total number of pupils = \\( 222 + 618 = 840 \\).\n\nTherefore, assuming the original number of girls was 200, the total number of pupils in the school now is 840. \n\n### \nThe total number of pupils in the school now is 840 (assuming 200 original girls).",

        "clear answer": "To find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake in the park, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons each of them had.\n\n1. **Calculate the total balloons that Jake had:**\n   - Initially, Jake brought 2 balloons.\n   - Jake then bought 3 more balloons at the park.\n   - Therefore, Jake had: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) balloons.\n\n2. **Determine the number of balloons Allan had:**\n   - Allan initially brought 6 balloons and did not buy any more.\n\n3. **Find the difference between the number of balloons Allan and Jake had:**\n   - The difference is: \\(6 - 5 = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.\n\n### Final Answer: Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find the solution, we need to determine the number of balloons Jake had at the park and compare it to the number Allan had.\n\n1. **Determine the number of balloons Jake has:**\n   - Let's let \\( x \\) represent the number of balloons Jake initially brought to the park.\n   - Jake then bought 3 more balloons at the park.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of balloons Jake has at the park is:\n   \\[\n   x + 3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the difference in the number of balloons:**\n   - Allan initially brought 6 balloons to the park.\n   - We are asked to find how many more balloons Allan had than Jake at the park. Thus, the difference in the number of balloons between Allan and Jake is:\n   \\[\n   6 - (x + 3) = 6 - x - 3 = 3 - x\n   \\]\n\nSince we don't know the initial number of balloons Jake brought (\\( x \\)), we can\u2019t calculate the exact numerical difference without additional information about \\( x \\).\n\nAssuming Jake initially brought some specific number of balloons, you can calculate the difference. For example, if Jake originally brought 4 balloons:\n- Total balloons Jake has = \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\)\n- Difference = \\( 6 - 7 = -1 \\) (Jake has 1 more than Allan)\n\nHowever, without the initial number of balloons Jake brought, we cannot provide a specific number for the difference without an assumption.\n\n### Final Answer: Without knowing how many balloons Jake initially brought, the difference cannot be calculated. The difference in balloons is \\( 3 - x \\). Assuming Jake initially brought, for example, 5 balloons, Allan would have \\( 3 - 5 = -2 \\) balloons, meaning Jake would have 2 more balloons than Allan. The answer varies based on the assumption for \\( x \\).",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of pupils in the school given the following information:\n\n1. There are 692 girls in the school.\n2. There are 458 more girls than boys in the school.\n\nFirst, let's define the number of boys as \\( b \\).\n\nAccording to the given information:\n\\[ 692 = b + 458. \\]\n\nTo find \\( b \\), solve the equation:\n\\[ b = 692 - 458. \\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\\[ b = 234. \\]\n\nSo, there are 234 boys in the school.\n\nNow, to find the total number of pupils in the school, we sum the number of girls and boys:\n\\[ \\text{Total pupils} = \\text{Number of girls} + \\text{Number of boys}. \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[ \\text{Total pupils} = 692 + 234. \\]\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\\[ \\text{Total pupils} = 926. \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 926.\n\n### 926",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to establish a relationship between the numbers of boys and girls. Let's denote the number of boys as \\( B \\), and the number of girls as \\( G \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 458 more girls than boys. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ G = B + 458 \\]\n\nThe total number of pupils, \\( T \\), is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:\n\n\\[ T = B + G \\]\n\nSubstitute the expression for \\( G \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ T = B + (B + 458) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ T = 2B + 458 \\]\n\nTo reach a numerical answer, we'll need to assume either an explicit number for of boys or the total. Since the problem does not provide explicit values, let's assume there are, for example, 200 boys in the school.\n\n\\[ B = 200 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( B = 200 \\) into the equation for total number of pupils:\n\n\\[ T = 2(200) + 458 \\]\n\n\\[ T = 400 + 458 \\]\n\n\\[ T = 858 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of pupils in the school is 858.\n\n### 858 ###",

He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 7 friends.\n\nLet's first calculate the number of crackers each friend gets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Crackers per friend} = \\frac{\\text{Total crackers}}{\\text{Number of friends}} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n\\]\n\nEach friend gets 2 crackers. \n\nNow, let's determine how many cakes each friend gets. The problem states that he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend. Therefore, each friend must also get 2 cakes.\n\nSince we are required to assume a certain number of cakes (as it's not provided in the question), let's assume Matthew had 14 cakes initially, as this is a reasonable guess given he had 14 crackers.\n\nThus, the division of cakes would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cakes per friend} = \\frac{\\text{Total cakes}}{\\text{Number of friends}} = \\frac{14}{7} = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, each friend would receive 2 crackers and 2 cakes.\n\n### Final Answer: Each friend ate 2 crackers and 2 cakes. ###",

        "clear answer": "To determine how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Count of Birds:**  \n   The problem states there are 6 birds initially on the fence.\n\n2. **Initial Count of Storks:**  \n   Initially, there are 3 storks.\n\n3. **Two More Storks Join:**  \n   Two more storks come to join them, so the total number of storks now is \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n\n4. **Comparing Numbers:**\n   - There are 6 birds.\n   - There are 5 storks.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference:**  \n   To find how many more birds there are than storks, subtract the number of storks from the number of birds:  \n   \\(6 - 5 = 1\\).\n\nThus, there is 1 more bird than stork sitting on the fence.\n\n### 1",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the difference between the total number of birds and the total number of storks sitting on the fence. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Information:**\n   - Number of birds = 6\n   - We don't know the initial number of storks, so let's assume there were \\( x \\) storks initially.\n\n2. **Storks Joining:**\n   - 2 more storks joined the group, so the total number of storks becomes \\( x + 2 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Difference:**\n   - We need to find how many more birds there are compared to storks. So, we need to compute:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Number of birds} - \\text{Number of storks}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 6 - (x + 2)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 6 - x - 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 4 - x\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - To have a concrete numerical answer, assume a random value for \\( x \\). If we assume \\( x = 2 \\) (originally 2 storks were there), the number of storks becomes \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\).\n   - In this case:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 4 - 2 = 2\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 2 more birds than storks sitting on the fence. ###2",

        "ambiguos question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers, and together they planted 55 seeds. They put some seeds in each flower bed, and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?",
        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Flower Beds:**\n    - Paige and her mom planted a total of 55 seeds.\n    - They put 15 seeds in each flower bed.\n\n   We calculate the number of flower beds by dividing the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of flower beds} = \\frac{55 \\text{ seeds}}{15 \\text{ seeds per bed}} = 3.6667\n   \\]\n\n   Since you can't have a fraction of a flower bed in practical terms, they must have used either 3 or 4 flower beds. Let's assume they manage to squeeze all seeds in 4 flower beds as they are integer values.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Seeds That Grew:**\n    - Each of the 4 flower beds has seeds planted.\n    - We're told that 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. It's likely that the problem statement has a typographical error assuming too many seeds grew.\n\n    Actually, consider if we adjust the value by correcting the problem statement to a realistic approach, e.g. 10 seeds grow into 10 flowers. But since we must adhere to an already-given condition related to realistic growth, let's calculate based on the value of 15 seeds filling beds but this time recounting grew number assuming stating error solved as per correct 4 beds correctly held seeds:\n\n    Since each flower bed has 15 seeds, let's set it 10 seeds grow into flowers per bed, reflecting each seed has grown avoiding conflict note in step of considering 60 grew.\n\n   Then the calculation results for four equal beds makes;\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flowers grown} = 4 \\times 10 = 40\n   \\]\n\n### \nThus, the number of flowers that grew is 40.",
        "ambiguos answer": "The problem as stated appears to have some inconsistencies or missing information. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Seeds Planted:** Paige and her mom planted a total of 55 seeds.\n\n2. **Seeds Growing into Flowers:** The question mentions \"60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.\" This seems to imply there are more seeds than originally planted, which doesn't make sense with the context provided.\n\nTo solve this problem realistically, we would typically need the following information:\n- The germination rate (percentage of seeds that grow into flowers).\n- The distribution or number of flower beds.\n\nSince some information appears to be missing or inconsistent (planting 55 seeds but having 60 seeds grow in each bed), let's make an assumption to resolve the issue and provide a possible solution.\n\n### Assumptions and Solution:\n\nLet's assume there was a typographical error, and perhaps it should state that those seeds that were planted grew successfully or turned into flowers.\n\nA logical assumption could be that all 55 seeds grew into flowers, given the lack of information about germination rates or failure rates.\n\nThus, under the assumption that all planted seeds grew, the answer would be simply:\n\n**55 flowers grew.**\n\n### 55",

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the room:**  \n   The length of the room is given as 2 feet and the width is given as 12 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of the room} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 2 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 12 \\, \\text{feet} = 24 \\, \\text{square feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of one tile:**  \n   It's stated that each tile covers 4 square feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**  \n   To find out how many tiles are needed, divide the total area of the room by the area covered by one tile:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of tiles needed} = \\frac{\\text{Area of the room}}{\\text{Area of one tile}} = \\frac{24 \\, \\text{square feet}}{4 \\, \\text{square feet/tile}} = 6 \\, \\text{tiles}\n   \\]\n\n###  \nTherefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the whole floor.",

However, we need to know the size of each tile to proceed with the calculation. Since the size of the tiles isn't provided, let's assume a common tile size: 1 foot by 1 foot.\n\nThe steps to find the solution are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the area of the floor:\n   - The room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide.\n   - Area = length \u00d7 width = 2 feet \u00d7 12 feet = 24 square feet.\n\n2. Calculate how many tiles are needed:\n   - Assuming each tile covers an area of 1 square foot.\n   - Therefore, the number of tiles required = area of the floor / area of one tile.\n   - Number of tiles = 24 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 24 tiles.\n\n### 24 tiles",

We will assume each garden has the same number of pots, but the specific number of pots per garden isn't given in the problem. We'll assume there are 5 pots in each garden to proceed with the calculations.\n\nHere's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the given values:**\n   - Number of gardens = 10\n   - Each pot contains = 32 flowers\n\n2. **Assume a value for missing information:**\n   - Assume each garden has 5 pots.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of pots:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pots} = \\text{Number of gardens} \\times \\text{Number of pots per garden} = 10 \\times 5 = 50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of flowers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total flowers} = \\text{Total pots} \\times \\text{Number of flowers per pot} = 50 \\times 32 = 1600\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, based on the assumption of 5 pots per garden, there are 1600 flowers in all.\n\n### 1600",

        "ambiguos question": "Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. If he also has 10 books on the shelf, how many more action figures than books were on his shelf?",
        "clear answer": "To determine how many more action figures than books are on Jerry's shelf, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of action figures:**\n   - Initially, Jerry has 9 action figures.\n   - He adds 7 more action figures.\n   - Total action figures = 9 + 7 = 16\n\n2. **Determine the number of books:**\n   - Jerry has 10 books on the shelf.\n\n3. **Find the difference between the number of action figures and the number of books:**\n   - Number of action figures = 16\n   - Number of books = 10\n   - Difference = 16 - 10 = 6\n\nThere are 6 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.\n\n### There are 6 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, let's first define the variables and understand the situation:\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) represent the original number of action figures Jerry had on the shelf.\n2. Jerry added 7 more action figures to the shelf. This means the total number of action figures on the shelf is now \\( x + 7 \\).\n3. Jerry has 10 books on the shelf.\n\nWe are asked to find out how many more action figures than books are on the shelf. This can be calculated by finding the difference between the number of action figures and the number of books.\n\nThe expression for the number of action figures minus the number of books is:\n\n\\[\n(x + 7) - 10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n\n\\[\nx + 7 - 10 = x - 3\n\\]\n\nWithout more information about the original number of action figures \\( x \\), we cannot determine a specific numerical result.\n\nTo proceed, we assume a random value for \\( x \\). Let's assume Jerry initially had 10 action figures. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nx = 10\n\\]\n\nNow calculate the difference:\n\n\\[\n10 + 7 - 10 = 10 - 3 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 7 more action figures than books on the shelf.\n\n### The answer is 7.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step:\n\n1. Initially, there are 2 birds sitting on the fence.\n2. Then, 5 more birds join them. So the total number of birds on the fence now is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 5 = 7 \\text{ birds}\n   \\]\n\n3. Additionally, 4 storks come to join them. There are now 4 storks on the fence.\n\n4. We need to find out how many more birds than storks are on the fence. We do this by subtracting the number of storks from the number of birds:\n   \\[\n   7 \\text{ birds} - 4 \\text{ storks} = 3 \\text{ more birds than storks}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.\n\n###  \nThe final answer is 3.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we first need to define the initial conditions and then follow the changes described in the scenario:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with some initial number of birds sitting on the fence. Let's call this number \\( x \\). However, the problem does not provide this initial number explicitly. Therefore, we assume it was zero, so initially, no birds were sitting on the fence.\n\n2. **Additional Birds and Storks**: According to the problem, 5 more birds and 4 more storks come to join them on the fence.\n\n3. **After Movements**:\n   - Number of birds on the fence: Initially zero (by our assumption) plus 5 more birds that joined, gives a total of \\( 0 + 5 = 5 \\) birds.\n   - Number of storks on the fence: Initially zero plus 4 more storks that joined, gives a total of \\( 0 + 4 = 4 \\) storks.\n\n4. **Difference Calculation**: Finally, we calculate how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence:\n   \\[\n   \\text{More birds than storks} = 5 - 4 = 1\n   \\]\n\n### The answer is: 1.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of candy Bobby has after eating a certain amount. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Candy Pieces:**\n   - Bobby starts with 21 pieces of candy.\n\n2. **First Consumption:**\n   - Bobby eats 5 pieces of candy.\n   - Calculation: 21 pieces (initial) - 5 pieces (eaten) = 16 pieces remaining.\n\n3. **Second Consumption:**\n   - Bobby eats an additional 9 pieces of candy.\n   - Calculation: 16 pieces (remaining after the first consumption) - 9 pieces (eaten) = 7 pieces remaining.\n\nTherefore, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left.\n\n### 7",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby has left, we need to consider the steps he took:\n\n1. **Initial Quantity:**\n   Bobby started with 21 pieces of candy.\n\n2. **He ate some initial pieces:**\n   Bobby ate 5 pieces initially.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces left after eating 5 pieces} = 21 - 5 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. **He ate some more:**\n   The problem states that Bobby ate some more pieces of candy, but it doesn't specify how many. Since there is no specific number given for this additional amount, we must make an assumption. To proceed, I'll assume he ate 7 more pieces (as an arbitrary number).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total pieces eaten} = 5 + 7 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate remaining pieces:**\n   The number of pieces Bobby has left after eating a total of 12 pieces is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pieces left} = 21 - 12 = 9\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nBobby has 9 pieces of candy left.",

        "clear answer": "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the known quantities:**\n   - There are 7 pieces of gum in each package.\n   - Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum.\n   - The total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41.\n\n2. **Set up an equation to represent the relationships described:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of packages Robin has.\n   - Since there are 7 pieces of gum in each package, the total number of pieces of gum from the packages is \\( 7x \\).\n   - Therefore, the equation representing the total pieces of gum is:\n     \\[\n     7x + 6 = 41\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     7x = 41 - 6\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the right side:\n     \\[\n     7x = 35\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{35}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the result:**\n   - Robin has 5 packages of gum.\n\nThe number of packages Robin has is \\(\\boxed{5}\\). \n\n###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packages of gum Robin has. We know that Robin has an additional 6 pieces of gum along with the ones in the packages, and the total number of pieces of gum is 41. \n\nLet's assume each package contains \\( x \\) pieces of gum. If Robin has \\( n \\) packages, the number of pieces of gum in the packages is given by:\n\n\\[ n \\times x \\]\n\nAccording to the problem, adding the 6 extra pieces of gum to the pieces in the packages gives a total of 41 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ n \\times x + 6 = 41 \\]\n\nFrom this, we can solve for \\( n \\times x \\):\n\n\\[ n \\times x = 41 - 6 \\]\n\\[ n \\times x = 35 \\]\n\nThe equation means that the product of the number of packages \\( n \\) and the number of pieces per package \\( x \\) must be 35. \n\nTo find how many packages Robin has, we need to consider possible values of \\( n \\) and \\( x \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's explore possible pairs:\n\n1. If \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( x = 35 \\).\n2. If \\( n = 5 \\), then \\( x = 7 \\).\n3. If \\( n = 7 \\), then \\( x = 5 \\).\n4. If \\( n = 35 \\), then \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nSince the problem does not specify how many pieces are in each package, we can choose any valid pair. To keep it reasonable, let's assume that one package doesn't contain all the pieces and choose the pair:\n\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (packages) \n- \\( x = 7 \\) (pieces per package)\n\nThus, Robin has 5 packages of gum.\n\n### Answer: 5 packages",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balloons each person had at the park and then find the difference.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of balloons Allan had:**\n   - Allan brought 6 balloons.\n   - Since the problem does not mention Allan obtaining more balloons at the park, Allan still has 6 balloons.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of balloons Jake had:**\n   - Jake initially brought 3 balloons.\n   - Jake then bought 4 more balloons at the park.\n\n   Total balloons Jake had = Initial balloons + Additional balloons bought\n   \\[\n   3 + 4 = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many more balloons Jake had than Allan:**\n   - Jake\u2019s total number of balloons at the park is 7.\n   - Allan\u2019s total number of balloons at the park is 6.\n\n   Difference in the number of balloons:\n   \\[\n   7 - 6 = 1\n   \\]\n\nThus, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.\n\n### Answer: Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan in the park. ###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balloons Jake has after buying additional balloons at the park, and then compare this number to the number of balloons Allan has.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Initial Balloons:**\n   - Allan starts with 6 balloons.\n   - Jake starts with 3 balloons.\n\n2. **Jake Buys More Balloons:**\n   - We are not given how many more balloons Jake buys, so let's assume he buys \\( x \\) additional balloons.\n\n3. **Total Balloons:**\n   - After buying more balloons, Jake's total balloons = \\( 3 + x \\).\n   - Allan's total balloons remain at 6, since there's no information that he acquires more.\n\n4. **Difference in Balloons:**\n   - The problem asks how many more balloons Jake has than Allan.\n   - So, difference = (Jake's total balloons) - (Allan's total balloons).\n\nBased on our assumed purchase, the difference is given by:\n\n\\[\n(3 + x) - 6 = x - 3\n\\]\n\nThe answer depends on \\( x \\). Since the problem is open-ended for the number Jake buys, let\u2019s assume Jake buys 5 more balloons at the park for the sake of providing a concrete solution.\n\n5. **Concrete Numerical Solution (Assume \\( x = 5 \\)):**\n   - Jake's total balloons after buying: \\( 3 + 5 = 8 \\).\n   - Difference in the number of balloons Jake has compared to Allan: \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nJake has 2 more balloons than Allan in the park. \n\n### Markdown:\n2",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many kids Julia played with on both Monday and Tuesday combined, and then compare that to the number of kids she played with on Wednesday.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Number of kids on Monday:** 15 kids.\n2. **Number of kids on Tuesday:** The question does not give an explicit number, so we need to assume a value. For the sake of this problem, let's assume she played with 10 kids on Tuesday.\n3. **Number of kids on Wednesday:** 7 kids.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday:\n\\[ \\text{Total on Monday and Tuesday} = 15 + 10 = 25 \\]\n\nNext, compare the total number of kids on Monday and Tuesday to the number on Wednesday (7 kids):\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 25 - 7 = 18 \\]\n\nThus, Julia played with 18 more kids on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday.\n\n### The answer is 18.",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find out how many days Debby drank the water bottles given that she started with 301 bottles and drank 144 bottles per day until she had 157 bottles left.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial situation**: Debby starts with 301 water bottles.\n2. **Water bottles left after drinking**: Debby has 157 water bottles left.\n3. **Water bottles consumed**: We calculate how many bottles she drank:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bottles consumed} = \\text{Initial bottles} - \\text{Bottles left} = 301 - 157 = 144\n   \\]\n4. **Rate of consumption per day**: Debby drinks 144 bottles per day.\n5. **Number of days**: To find the number of days she drank, we divide the total bottles consumed by the daily rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{\\text{Bottles consumed}}{\\text{Bottles per day}} = \\frac{144}{144} = 1\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Debby drank for 1 day.\n\n### Answer: 1 day",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Debby drank water bottles given that she has some bottles left. Let's go through the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Bottles:**\n   - Debby initially had 301 water bottles.\n\n2. **Bottles Consumed Per Day:**\n   - She drank 144 bottles per day.\n\n3. **Determine Possible Days:**\n   - First, calculate the maximum number of full days she could drink at the given rate without exceeding the total number of bottles.\n   - If she drank for \\( n \\) full days, the total number of bottles consumed would be \\( 144n \\).\n\n4. **Bottles Left Condition:**\n   - Since she has some bottles left after drinking, \\( 144n < 301 \\).\n\n5. **Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   - To find the maximum number of full days \\( n \\) that satisfies \\( 144n < 301 \\), divide 301 by 144 (the number of bottles consumed per day):\n\n     \\[\n     n = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{301}{144} \\right\\rfloor\n     \\]\n\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{301}{144} \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{301}{144} \\approx 2.09027\n     \\]\n\n   - Taking the floor value gives \\( n = 2 \\).\n\n6. **Verify Bottles Left:**\n   - If she drinks for 2 full days, she consumes \\( 144 \\times 2 = 288 \\) bottles.\n   - The number of bottles left is:\n     \n     \\[\n     301 - 288 = 13\n     \\]\n\n   - This confirms she has some bottles left over after drinking for 2 days.\n\n### Final Answer: \nDebby drank water bottles for 2 days.",

Let \\( x \\) be the number of packs of cookies Lucy bought. The number of packs of cookies is missing from the problem, so we'll assume a random value for it to proceed with the calculation. Let's assume Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies.\n\n2. According to the problem, Lucy also bought 22 packs of cake.\n\n3. Additionally, Lucy purchased 16 packs of chocolate.\n\nNow, we add these numbers together to find the total number of packs of groceries:\n\n\\[\nx + 22 + 16\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the assumed value for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n10 + 22 + 16\n\\]\n\nCalculate the sum:\n\n\\[\n10 + 22 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\n32 + 16 = 48\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of packs of groceries Lucy bought is 48.\n\n### 48",

Allan buys an unknown number of additional balloons at the park.\n\nLet's assume Allan bought \\( x \\) additional balloons at the park. Therefore, Allan would have a total of:\n\n\\[ 2 + x \\] balloons.\n\nJake has 6 balloons altogether. We are asked to find how many more balloons Jake has than Allan, which is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Jake's Balloons} - \\text{Allan's Balloons} = 6 - (2 + x) \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 6 - 2 - x = 4 - x \\]\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide how many balloons Allan bought at the park, let's assume a random value for \\( x \\). For example, let \\( x = 2 \\) (assuming Allan bought 2 more balloons):\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 4 - 2 = 2 \\]\n\nWith this assumption, Jake has 2 more balloons than Allan.\n\nTherefore, if Allan bought 2 additional balloons, Jake has 2 more balloons than Allan. \n\nSo, the final answer, given our assumption, is:\n\n### 2",

        "clear answer": "To find the total number of kids Julia played with over the three days, we need to add the number of kids she played with on each day.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of kids she played with on each day:\n   - Monday: 13 kids\n   - Tuesday: 10 kids\n   - Wednesday: 15 kids\n\n2. Add these numbers together to find the total:\n   \\[\n   13 \\text{ (Monday)} + 10 \\text{ (Tuesday)} + 15 \\text{ (Wednesday)} = 38 \\text{ kids}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of kids Julia played with altogether is 38 kids.\n\n### 38",

Let's assume she played with 5 kids on Monday, just to assign a value for calculation purposes:\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{Total kids} = 5 + 25 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, if Julia played with 5 kids on Monday, then ### 30 ### kids is the total number of kids she played with altogether.\n\nIf you need the answer computed with a different assumption for \\( x \\), please specify or feel free to change the assumption accordingly.",

Therefore, Edward must have had at least $17 before he began spending any money.\n\nSince the problem does not specify how much money Edward has left after spending (it just says he \"has some amount of money\" now), we assume that he started with at least as much as he spent.\n\nEdward had at least $17 before spending his money.\n\n### $17",

        "clear answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bottle caps Danny had initially, before he found new ones and threw some away.\n\nLet's denote the number of bottle caps Danny initially had as \\( x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n1. Danny found 63 bottle caps, so he added these to his collection.\n2. He threw away 51 bottle caps from his old ones.\n3. He ended up with 33 bottle caps in his collection.\n\nLet's write an equation based on these steps:\n\n\\[ x + 63 - 51 = 33 \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation:\n\n1. Combine the constants:\n   \\[ 63 - 51 = 12 \\]\n\n2. Substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[ x + 12 = 33 \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 12 from both sides:\n   \\[ x = 33 - 12 \\]\n   \\[ x = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, Danny initially had 21 bottle caps.\n\n### Danny initially had 21 bottle caps.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to work backwards from the information provided. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the information:\n\n1. Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park.\n2. He then threw away 51 old ones.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of bottle caps Danny had at first.\n\nAfter finding 63 bottle caps, Danny's total became \\( x + 63 \\). \n\nThen he threw away 51 bottle caps, leaving him with:\n\\[ x + 63 - 51 \\]\n\nSuppose the number of bottle caps Danny has after these actions is \\( y \\). However, we cannot determine \\( y \\) directly from the information given. Since his final count is not specified, let\u2019s proceed with a hypothetical situation assuming he has a certain number of bottle caps now to find \\( x \\).\n\n\\[\ny = x + 63 - 51\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\\[\ny = x + 12 \n\\]\n\nSince \\( y \\) wasn't given, we can assume any plausible number, say \\( y = 100 \\). This way we can find out how many he started with.\n\nAssuming \\( y = 100 \\):\n\\[\n100 = x + 12 \n\\]\n\\[\nx = 100 - 12 \n\\]\n\\[\nx = 88 \n\\]\n\nThus, Danny initially had 88 bottle caps.\n\n### \nThe number of bottle caps Danny had at first is 88.\n###",

Here's how we can calculate that:\n\n1. **Determine weekly income after rent:**\n   - Lewis earns $491 every week.\n   - He needs to pay $216 in rent every week.\n   - Weekly net income = Earnings - Rent = $491 - $216 = $275.\n\n2. **Calculate total savings at the end of the harvest season:**\n   - The harvest season lasts for 1181 weeks.\n   - Total money saved at the end of the harvest = Weekly net income \u00d7 Number of weeks = $275 \u00d7 1181.\n\n3. **Perform the final multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   275 \\times 1181 = 324,775.\n   \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season is $324,775.\n\n### $324,775",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract his total rent payments over the 1181 weeks. Since we don't have the rent amount given, we'll assume a random value for it.\n\nLet's assume Lewis's weekly rent is $200.\n\nHere are the calculation steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Earnings**:   \n   Lewis earns $491 per week.   \n   Total earnings over 1181 weeks = $491 * 1181 = $579,871.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Rent Payments**:   \n   Assuming the rent is $200 per week,   \n   Total rent over 1181 weeks = $200 * 1181 = $236,200.\n\n3. **Calculate Net Amount Lewis Will Have**:   \n   Total remaining money = Total earnings - Total rent payments   \n   = $579,871 - $236,200 = $343,671.\n\nThus, Lewis will have $343,671 at the end of the 1181 weeks after paying his weekly rent of $200.\n\n### $343,671",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many customers left when the number of customers changed.\n\nLet's start by organizing what we know:\n- Initially, the waiter had 13 customers.\n- Some customers left, but we don't know how many.\n- After some customers left, 4 new customers arrived.\n- In the end, the waiter had 9 customers.\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the number of customers who left. \n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n1. Start with the initial number of customers: 13.\n2. Subtract the number of customers that left: 13 - \\( x \\).\n3. Add the 4 new customers: \\( 13 - x + 4 \\).\n4. Set the expression equal to the current total of customers, which is 9:\n   \\[\n   13 - x + 4 = 9\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   17 - x = 9\n   \\]\n6. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   17 - 9 = x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, 8 customers left.\n\n### 8 customers left.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many customers left after initially having some number of customers.\n\nLet's denote the initial number of customers as \\( x \\).\n\nWe know from the problem that:\n\n1.

The resulting number of customers after some left and 4 new arrived is 9.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this situation:\n\n\\[ x - y + 4 = 9 \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( y \\), the number of customers who left.

        "ambiguos question": "Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. On the way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Marco has some strawberries. How much do his dad's strawberries weigh now?",
        "clear answer": "To find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now, we'll go through the following steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total weight of the strawberries collected by Marco and his dad initially.**\n\n   Total initial weight = 36 pounds\n\n2. **Determine how many pounds of strawberries Marco originally had.**\n\n   Let's call the weight of Marco's strawberries initially \\( M \\) pounds. According to the problem, Marco now has 12 pounds of strawberries. \n\n   So initially:\n   \\[\n   M = 12 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the initial weight of the dad's strawberries.**\n\n   Since the total combined initial weight was 36 pounds:\n   \\[\n   M + D = 36 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the value of \\( M \\):\n   \\[\n   12 + D = 36\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( D \\), the initial weight of the dad's strawberries:\n   \\[\n   D = 36 - 12 = 24 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the current weight of the dad's strawberries after losing 8 pounds.**\n\n   The dad initially had 24 pounds and lost 8 pounds:\n   \\[\n   D_{\\text{now}} = 24 - 8 = 16 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The current weight of the dad's strawberries is 16 pounds.\n\n### Answer: 16 pounds.",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the initial total weight of strawberries collected by Marco and his dad. According to the problem, this is 36 pounds.\n\n2. Assume Marco collected \\( M \\) pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marco's dad must have collected \\( 36 - M \\) pounds, since their total initial collection was 36 pounds.\n\n3. Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries on the way back. Therefore, the remaining weight of his dad's strawberries is:\n   \\[\n   (36 - M) - 8 \n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   \\[\n   36 - M - 8 = 28 - M\n   \\]\n\nSince no specific information is given about how much Marco collected, we don't have an exact numerical value for \\( M \\). We can choose a reasonable assumption for \\( M \\). \n\nFor simplicity, let's assume Marco collected half of the total strawberries (an assumption to illustrate the calculation):\n\n- Assume \\( M = \\frac{36}{2} = 18 \\).\n\nPlugging this value into the expression:\n   \\[\n   28 - M = 28 - 18 = 10 \\text{ pounds}\n   \\]\n\nBased on this assumption, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 10 pounds.\n\n### Therefore, assuming Marco picked 18 pounds, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 10 pounds.",

        "clear answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boys are in the school, and then calculate the total number of pupils by adding the number of girls and boys together.\n\nWe are told:\n- There are 868 girls in the school.\n- There are 281 more girls than boys.\n\nLet \\( b \\) be the number of boys in the school. According to the problem, we have:\n\n\\[ 868 = b + 281 \\]\n\nTo find the number of boys, solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 868 - 281 \\]\n\nCalculate \\( 868 - 281 \\):\n\n\\[ 868 - 281 = 587 \\]\n\nSo, there are 587 boys in the school.\n\nNow, calculate the total number of pupils in the school by adding the number of girls and boys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pupils} = \\text{Number of girls} + \\text{Number of boys} = 868 + 587\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( 868 + 587 \\):\n\n\\[ 868 + 587 = 1455 \\]\n\nThus, the total number of pupils in the school is 1455.\n\n### 1455",
        "ambiguos answer": "To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to determine how many boys and girls there are. We know:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of boys in the school.\n- Then, the number of girls in the school is \\( b + 281 \\) (since there are 281 more girls than boys).\n\nThe total number of pupils in the school is the sum of the number of boys and girls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pupils} = b + (b + 281)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pupils} = 2b + 281\n\\]\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume a specific value for \\( b \\) (the number of boys), since it was not given in the question. Let's assume there are 100 boys in the school. Then:\n\n- The number of girls would be \\( 100 + 281 = 381 \\).\n\nThus, the total number of pupils would be:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 100 + 281 = 200 + 281 = 481\n\\]\n\n### The total number of pupils in the school, assuming there are 100 boys, is 481.",

        "ambiguos question": "Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year, he gave 563 crayons to his friends. If he only had 332 crayons left, how many crayons did he get for his birthday?",
        "clear answer": "To find out how many crayons Paul originally received for his birthday, we need to account for all the crayons he gave away, lost, and still has left. Let's denote the original number of crayons Paul received as \\( x \\).\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Crayons Given Away:**\n   Paul gave 563 crayons to his friends.\n\n2. **Crayons Lost:**\n   Paul lost 558 crayons.\n\n3. **Crayons Remaining:**\n   Paul has 332 crayons left.\n\nThe total number of crayons Paul ended up using or losing is the sum of the crayons he gave away and lost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total used or lost} = 563 + 558 = 1121\n\\]\n\nNow, Paul still has 332 crayons left, and the sum of these must equal the total number of crayons he originally had, \\( x \\). Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx - 1121 = 332\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), add 1121 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 332 + 1121\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n\\[\nx = 1453\n\\]\n\nThus, Paul originally received 1,453 crayons for his birthday.\n\n### Final Answer: 1453 crayon###",
        "ambiguos answer": "To determine how many crayons Paul initially received for his birthday, we can create an equation based on the given information.\n\n1. Let \\( x \\) be the number of crayons Paul received for his birthday.\n\n2. We know that Paul gave away 563 crayons to his friends.\n\n3. After giving away 563 crayons, Paul has 332 crayons left.\n\nThe relationship can therefore be expressed in the equation:\n\\[\nx - 563 = 332\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), solve the equation by adding 563 to both sides:\n\\[\nx = 332 + 563\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 895\n\\]\n\nThus, Paul received 895 crayons for his birthday.\n\n### 895",

Let:\n\n- \\( g \\) be the number of girls in the school.\n- \\( b \\) be the number of boys in the school.\n- \\( T \\) be the total number of pupils in the school.\n\nAccording to the problem, there are 142 more boys than girls. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ b = g + 142 \\]\n\nThe total number of pupils in the school is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys:\n\n\\[ T = g + b \\]\n\nSubstitute the expression for \\( b \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ T = g + (g + 142) \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ T = 2g + 142 \\]\n\nTo find a specific numerical value for \\( T \\), we need a concrete number for \\( g \\). Since the problem does not specify the number of girls, we will assume a random value for \\( g \\).\n\nLet's assume there are 100 girls in the school. Then:\n\n\\[ T = 2(100) + 142 \\]\n\\[ T = 200 + 142 \\]\n\\[ T = 342 \\]\n\nTherefore, assuming there are 100 girls, there would be 342 pupils in the school.\n\nThe concrete final answer is: \n\n### 342 ###\n\nThis answer depends on the assumption of the number of girls.

In the morning, 36 campers went rowing.\n2. In the afternoon, 13 campers went rowing.\n3. In the evening, 49 campers went rowing.\n\nTo find the total number of campers who went rowing, we need to add these numbers together:\n\n\\[\n36 \\, (\\text{morning}) + 13 \\, (\\text{afternoon}) + 49 \\, (\\text{evening})\n\\]\n\nLet's perform the addition step-by-step:\n\n1. Add the number of campers in the morning and afternoon:\n\n   \\[\n   36 + 13 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. Add the result to the number of campers in the evening:\n\n   \\[\n   49 + 49 = 98\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of campers who went rowing in all is 98.\n\n### 98",
        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of campers who went rowing. The statement gives us the number of campers in the afternoon but does not specify the numbers for the morning and evening rowers. Therefore, we will assume some values for them.\n\nLet's assume:\n- The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is \\( x \\).\n- The number of campers who went rowing in the evening is \\( y \\).\n\nUsing these assumptions, the problem asks us to calculate the total number of campers who went rowing during the day. The equation for the total number of campers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total campers} = x + 13 + y\n\\]\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), let's assume:\n- \\( x = 10 \\) (campers went rowing in the morning)\n- \\( y = 7 \\) (campers went rowing in the evening)\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total campers} = 10 + 13 + 7 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of campers who went rowing is 30.\n\n### 30",

        "ambiguos answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balloons that Allan and Jake have at the park.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of balloons Allan has:**\n   - Initially, Allan brought 3 balloons.\n   - Then, he bought 2 more balloons at the park.\n   - Therefore, the total number of balloons Allan has is:\n     \\[\n     3 + 2 = 5\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Determine the number of balloons Jake has:**\n   - The problem states \"Jake brought some balloons to the park\" but does not specify the exact number.\n   - Since no specific number is given, let's assume Jake brought \\( x \\) balloons to the park.\n\n3. **Total number of balloons at the park:**\n   - Combine the number of balloons Allan has with the number Jake has:\n   - Total = Number of Allan's balloons + Number of Jake's balloons\n   - Thus, the total number of balloons is:\n     \\[\n     5 + x\n     \\]\n\nSince the question does not provide the exact number of balloons Jake brought, we can't compute a precise numerical answer. If we assume, for example, Jake brought 3 balloons, then:\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n5 + x = 5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\n\nIf you want a concrete number, we'll assume Jake brought 3 balloons for calculation purposes:\n\n- Total number of balloons Allan and Jake have at the park is 8.\n\n### 8 ###\n\nThis value comes from assuming Jake brought 3 balloons, which we used to arrive at a concrete number.",

Unfortunately, the problem doesn't specify the amount or percentage by which the price was increased or the original price per t-shirt.\n\nTo proceed, let's assume that the increased price per t-shirt is $25 (as an example to calculate a concrete numerical answer). This assumption will allow us to demonstrate how to calculate the total revenue.\n\n**Calculation Steps**:\n\n1. **Assumed Increased Price per T-Shirt**: Let's assume it was $25.\n2. **Number of T-Shirts Sold**: 14 t-shirts.\n\nUsing the formula for total revenue:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = \\text{Price per T-Shirt} \\times \\text{Number of T-Shirts Sold} \\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 25 \\, (\\text{dollars per t-shirt}) \\times 14 \\, (\\text{t-shirts sold}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 350 \\, \\text{dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $350 from selling the 14 t-shirts.\n\n### $350",

When 5 more birds join, the total number of birds becomes \\( x + 5 \\).\n4. Therefore, the total number of birds and storks is the sum of the updated number of birds and the number of storks: \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total birds and storks} = (x + 5) + 2\n   \\]\n\n5.
