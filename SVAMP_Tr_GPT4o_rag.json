                "action": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many roses Jessica cut from her flower garden.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Situation**: Let \\( x \\) be the initial number of roses in the vase.\n\n2. **Roses Thrown Away**: Jessica threw away 4 roses. So, the number of roses left in the vase after throwing away is \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n3. **Roses Added**: Jessica cut some new roses and added them to the vase. Let \\( y \\) be the number of roses she cut and added.\n\n4. **Final Situation**: After adding the new roses, there are 23 roses in the vase.\n\nWe can set up the equation based on the final situation:\n\n\\[\nx - 4 + y = 23\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\( y \\), the number of roses Jessica cut. To do this, we need to express \\( y \\) in terms of known quantities:\n\n\\[\ny = 23 - (x - 4)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 23 - x + 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 27 - x\n\\]\n\nHowever, we don't have the initial number of roses \\( x \\). But we can solve for \\( y \\) directly by considering the change in the number of roses:\n\nSince the final number of roses is 23 and she threw away 4 roses, the number of roses she added must be enough to make up for the 4 thrown away and reach 23.\n\nThus, the number of roses she cut and added is:\n\n\\[\ny = 23 - (x - 4) = 23 - x + 4 = 27 - x\n\\]\n\nSince we don't have the initial number of roses, let's re-evaluate:\n\nThe change in the number of roses is due to throwing away 4 and then adding \\( y \\) to reach 23. Therefore, the number of roses she cut is simply the difference between the final count and the count after throwing away:\n\n\\[\ny = 23 - (x - 4) = 23 - (x - 4) = 23 - x + 4 = 27 - x\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( y \\) directly, consider:\n\nIf she threw away 4 roses and ended with 23, she must have added enough roses to make up for",
